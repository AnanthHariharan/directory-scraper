    "bio": "BioI am a molecular cell biologist with interdisciplinary training in protein biochemistry, bioengineering, molecular biology, and structural biology. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the laboratory of Manu Prakash at Stanford University. I earned my Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees in Biological Sciences from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata (IISER-K). Following this, I moved to Europe and joined the Biological Research Centre (BRC) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences as an ITC Fellow, where I completed a one-year training program in contemporary experimental biology and state-of-the-art techniques, along with a project on sarcomeric actin regulation in Jozsef Mihaly\u2019s lab. In 2016, I began my doctoral research in Cell Biology and Biochemistry as a Marie Curie Fellow in Carsten Janke\u2019s laboratory at Institut Curie, University of Paris-Saclay. My broader research interests include cytoskeletal regulation, proteomics, and the development of tools for molecular cell biology. I primarily use biochemical and bioengineering approaches to address my research questions. Beyond research, I enjoy reading, flying drones, running, playing pickleball, and driving. BioFirst-year undergraduate student and aspiring Bioengineering major. Originally from Sudbury, Canada. Among many things, I'm fascinated by structural virology, medical device development, and the cancerous extracellular matrix. Currently, I'm running a project to develop a novel, broad-spectrum Hepatitis E vaccine at Stanford.

Full time Mechanical Engineer at Intuitive Surgical. \u2192 Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine.\u2192 Grew an interest in the medical device field through self led research in developing a prosthetic for a user with a congenital limb deficiency of the hand.\u2192 Later grew passionate about Minimally Invasive Surgery through industry experience in Neuroendovascular Surgery.\u2192 Strongly believe that Minimally Invasive Surgical Robotics is an imperative step to catalyzing a paradigm shift in significantly improving patient outcomes and broadening scope of impact.  Current Research and Scholarly InterestsMy research is focused on how motor control is encoded at a neuronal level. On the theoretical side, I develop mathematical methods for analyzing neural data and modeling the relationships between neurons and motor function. On the applied side, I build computational frameworks for processing large datasets and interfacing with hardware. My goals are to gain insights on how networks of neurons work in harmony to generate movement and to improve the design of brain-machine interfaces.       BioPassionate and driven first-year M.S. Mechanical Engineering student at Stanford University with a strong interest in Electronics, Product Design, and Manufacturing. I look forward to improving through means of high-quality and innovative techniques our daily life. Dynamic problem solver persuaded to contribute to and learn immensely in the academic and professional fields.         Current Research and Scholarly InterestsWe study the role of the lysosome in metabolic adaptation using subcellular omics approaches, functional genomics and innovative biochemical tools. We apply this knowledge to understand how lysosomal dysfunction leads to human diseases including neurodegeneration, cancer and metabolic syndrome.      Current Research and Scholarly InterestsI am an Assistant Professor jointly appointed to both the Computer Science and the Electrical Engineering Departments at Stanford University. My research focuses on new techniques and tools, specifically new programming languages, compilers, and runtime systems, that enable end-users to more easily develop computations that exploit the potential of emerging computing platforms that exhibit analog behaviors.        BioPhil is an Electrical Engineering PhD student conducting inter-disciplinary medical imaging research in the Radiological Sciences Laboratory in the Stanford Medicine Department of Radiology. His research interests include MR methods for metabolic imaging, particularly Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI), and Deep Learning methods for solving inverse problems in limited data regimes with applications to MRI.  Current Research and Scholarly InterestsDevan's research at Stanford is focused on reducing inequities in health, education, and society. Devan is leveraging multiple sources of data within the state of California and nationwide to develop a holistic Energy Poverty Index to evaluate and guide policy. Devan's research addresses disparities in racial equity by helping to identify communities and schools that are most vulnerable and at-risk based on socio-economic, health, and environmental factors.  Current Research and Scholarly InterestsMy research lies in the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Healthcare, Ambient Intelligence, and Computational Neuroscience.    BioKemi\u2019s research interests include transnational, Afro-German, and migrant literature. Her work explores the representations of the inter- and intra-migrant relations in contemporary German migrant literature.Before joining Stanford's German Department as a Ph.D. student in 2022, she earned a B.A. degree in German from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, in 2019, and completed her M.A. program in German from the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, in 2022. She is a 2024/25 student fellow at the Hoover Institution, exploring topics about the migration issue in Germany and the AfD political party. She is also a fellow and mentor of the EDGE fellowship (Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education).                           Current Research and Scholarly InterestsComputer Graphics, Human Computer Interaction and Visualization.                   BioI am a Ph.D. student @ Stanford advised by Dr. John Cioffi.

    "bio": "BACKGROUND: Machine learning is a promising approach to personalize atrial fibrillation management strategies for patients after catheter ablation. Prior atrial fibrillation ablation outcome prediction studies applied classical machine learning methods to hand-crafted clinical scores, and none have leveraged intracardiac electrograms or 12-lead surface electrocardiograms for outcome prediction. We hypothesized that (1) machine learning models trained on electrograms or ECG signals can perform better at predicting patient outcomes after atrial fibrillation ablation than existing clinical scores and (2) multimodal fusion of electrogram, ECG, and clinical features can further improve the prediction of patient outcomes.METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation between 2015 and 2017 with panoramic left atrial electrogram before ablation and clinical follow-up for at least 1 year following ablation were included. Convolutional neural network and a novel multimodal fusion framework were developed for predicting 1-year atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation from electrogram, ECG signals, and clinical features. The models were trained and validated using 10-fold cross-validation on patient-level splits.RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six patients (64.5\u00b110.5 years, 74% male, 42% paroxysmal) were analyzed. Using electrogram signals alone, the convolutional neural network achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.731, outperforming the existing APPLE scores (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve=0.644) and CHA2DS2-VASc scores (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve=0.650). Similarly using 12-lead ECG alone, the convolutional neural network achieved an AUROC of 0.767. Combining electrogram, ECG, and clinical features, the fusion model achieved an AUROC of 0.859, outperforming single and dual modality models.CONCLUSIONS: Deep neural networks trained on electrogram or ECG signals improved the prediction of catheter ablation outcome compared with existing clinical scores, and fusion of electrogram, ECG, and clinical features further improved the prediction. This suggests the promise of using machine learning to help treatment planning for patients after catheter ablation.

This may delay or misdirect therapy.OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that deep learning (DL) can accurately classify AF from AT by revealing electrogram (EGM) signatures.METHODS: We studied 86 patients in whom the diagnosis of AF or AT was established at electrophysiological study (25 female, 65\u00b111 years). Custom DL architectures were trained to identify AF using N=29,340 unipolar and N=23,760 bipolar EGM segments. We compared DL to traditional classifiers based on rate or regularity. We explained DL using computer models to assess the impact of controlled variations in shape, rate and timing on AF/AT classification in 246,067 EGMs reconstructed from clinical data.RESULTS: DL identified AF with AUC of 0.97\u00b10.04 (unipolar) and 0.92\u00b10.09 (bipolar). Rule-based classifiers misclassified 10-12% of cases. DL classification was explained by regularity in EGM shape (13%) or timing (26%), and rate (60%; p<0.001), and also by a set of unipolar EGM shapes that classified as AF independent of rate or regularity. Overall, the optimal AF 'fingerprint' comprised these specific EGM shapes, >15% timing variation, <0.48 correlation in beat-to-beat EGM shapes and CL<190ms (p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning of intracardiac EGMs can identify AF or AT via signatures of rate, regularity in timing or shape, and specific EGM shapes. Future work should examine if these signatures differ between different clinical subpopulations with AF.

We develop algorithms that can visualize spiral waves and their tip locations on curved atrial geometries. We use these algorithms to quantify differences in AF maps and spiral tip locations between 3D basket reconstructions, projection onto 3D anatomical shells and unfolded 2D surfaces.METHODS: We tested our algorithms in N = 20 patients in whom AF was recorded from 64-pole baskets (Abbott, CA). Phase maps were generated by non-proprietary software to identify the tips of spiral waves, indicated by phase singularities. The number and density of spiral tips were compared in patient-specific 3D shells constructed from the basket, as well as 3D maps from clinical electroanatomic mapping systems and 2D maps.RESULTS: Patients (59.4\u00b112.7 yrs, 60% M) showed 1.7\u00b10.8 phase singularities/patient, in whom ablation terminated AF in 11/20 patients (55%). There was no difference in the location of phase singularities, between 3D curved surfaces and 2D unfolded surfaces, with a median correlation coefficient between phase singularity density maps of 0.985 (0.978-0.990). No significant impact was noted by phase singularities location in more curved regions or relative to the basket location (p>0.1).CONCLUSIONS: AF maps and phase singularities mapped by endocardial baskets are qualitatively and quantitatively similar whether calculated by 3D phase maps on patient-specific curved atrial geometries or in 2D. Phase maps on patient-specific geometries may be easier to interpret relative to critical structures for ablation planning.

Patients were randomly allocated to independent training and testing cohorts in a 70:30 ratio, repeated K=10 fold. Support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained to 2 endpoints: (i) sustained VT/VF or (ii) mortality at 3 years. SVM provided superior classification. For patient-level predictions, we computed personalized MAP scores as the proportion of MAP beats predicting each endpoint. Patient-level predictions in independent test cohorts yielded c-statistics of 0.90 for sustained VT/VF (95% CI: 0.76-1.00) and 0.91 for mortality (95% CI: 0.83-1.00) and were the most significant multivariate predictors. Interpreting trained SVM revealed MAP morphologies that, using in silico modeling, revealed higher L-type calcium current or sodium calcium exchanger as predominant phenotypes for VT/VF.CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning of action potential recordings in patients revealed novel phenotypes for long-term outcomes in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Such computational phenotypes provide an approach which may reveal cellular mechanisms for clinical outcomes and could be applied to other conditions.

We hypothesized that convolutional neural networks (CNN) may enable objective analysis of intracardiac activation in AF, which could be applied clinically if CNN classifications could also be explained. Methods - We performed panoramic recording of bi-atrial electrical signals in AF. We used the Hilbert-transform to produce 175,000 image grids in 35 patients, labeled for rotational activation by experts who showed consistency but with variability (kappa=0.79). In each patient, ablation terminated AF. A CNN was developed and trained on 100,000 AF image grids, validated on 25,000 grids, then tested on a separate 50,000 grids. Results - In the separate test cohort (50,000 grids), CNN reproducibly classified AF image grids into those with/without rotational sites with 95.0% accuracy (CI 94.8-95.2%). This accuracy exceeded that of support vector machines, traditional linear discriminant and k-nearest neighbor statistical analyses. To probe the CNN, we applied Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping which revealed that the decision logic closely mimicked rules used by experts (C-statistic 0.96). Conclusions - Convolutional neural networks improved the classification of intracardiac AF maps compared to other analyses, and agreed with expert evaluation. Novel explainability analyses revealed that the CNN operated using a decision logic similar to rules used by experts, even though these rules were not provided in training. We thus describe a scaleable platform for robust comparisons of complex AF data from multiple systems, which may provide immediate clinical utility to guide ablation.

We tested whether non-invasive assessment of regional AF rate accurately represents intracardiac recordings. Methods: In 47 patients with AF (27 persistent, age 63 \u00b1 13 years) we performed 57-lead non-invasive Electrocardiographic Imaging (ECGI) in AF, simultaneously with 64-pole intracardiac signals of both atria. ECGI was reconstructed by Tikhonov regularization. We constructed personalized 3D AF rate distribution maps by Dominant Frequency (DF) analysis from intracardiac and non-invasive recordings. Results: Raw intracardiac and non-invasive DF differed substantially, by 0.54 Hz [0.13 - 1.37] across bi-atrial regions (R2 = 0.11). Filtering by high spectral organization reduced this difference to 0.10 Hz (cycle length difference of 1 - 11 ms) [0.03 - 0.42] for patient-level comparisons (R2 = 0.62), and 0.19 Hz [0.03 - 0.59] and 0.20 Hz [0.04 - 0.61] for median and highest DF, respectively. Non-invasive and highest DF predicted acute ablation success (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Non-invasive estimation of atrial activation rates is feasible and, when filtered by high spectral organization, provide a moderate estimate of intracardiac recording rates in AF. Non-invasive technology could be an effective tool to identify patients who may respond to AF ablation for personalized therapy.

We hypothesized that persistent AF consists of interacting organized areas which may enlarge, shrink or coalesce, and that patients whose AF areas enlarge by ablation are more likely to respond to therapy.We mapped vectorial propagation in persistent AF using wavefront fields (WFF), constructed from raw unipolar electrograms at 64-pole basket catheters, during ablation until termination (Group 1, N = 20 patients) or cardioversion (Group 2, N = 20 patients). Wavefront field mapping of patients (age 61.1 \u00b1 13.2 years, left atrium 47.1 \u00b1 6.9 mm) at baseline showed 4.6 \u00b1 1.0 organized areas, each separated by disorganization. Ablation of sites that led to termination controlled larger organized area than competing sites (44.1 \u00b1 11.1% vs. 22.4 \u00b1 7.0%, P < 0.001). In Group 1, ablation progressively enlarged unablated areas (rising from 32.2 \u00b1 15.7% to 44.1 \u00b1 11.1% of mapped atrium, P < 0.0001). In Group 2, organized areas did not enlarge but contracted during ablation (23.6 \u00b1 6.3% to 15.2 \u00b1 5.6%, P < 0.0001).Mapping wavefront vectors in persistent AF revealed competing organized areas. Ablation that progressively enlarged remaining areas was acutely successful, and sites where ablation terminated AF were surrounded by large organized areas. Patients in whom large organized areas did not emerge during ablation did not exhibit AF termination. Further studies should define how fibrillatory activity is organized within such areas and whether this approach can guide ablation.

We set out to map electrical patterns of disorganization and regions of reentrant activity in AF from the body surface using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI), calibrated to panoramic intracardiac recordings and referenced to AF termination by ablation. Methods - Bi-atrial intracardiac electrograms of 47 AF patients at ablation (30 persistent, 29 male, 63\u00b19 years) were recorded with 64-pole basket catheters and simultaneous 57-lead body surface ECGs. Atrial epicardial electrical activity was reconstructed and organized sites were invasively and non-invasively tracked in 3D using phase singularity (PS). In a subset of 17 patients, sites of AF organization were targeted for ablation. Results - Body surface mapping showed greater AF organization near intracardially-detected drivers than elsewhere, both in PS density (2.3\u00b12.1 vs 1.9\u00b11.6, p=0.02) and number of drivers (3.2\u00b12.3 vs 2.7\u00b11.7, p=0.02). Complexity, defined as the number of stable AF reentrant sites, was concordant between non-invasive and invasive methods (r2 =0.5, CC=0.71). In the subset receiving targeted ablation, AF complexity showed lower values in those in whom AF terminated than those in whom AF did not terminate (p<0.01). Conclusions - AF complexity tracked non-invasively correlates well with organized and disorganized regions detected by panoramic intracardiac mapping, and correlates with the acute outcome by ablation. This approach may assist in bedside monitoring of therapy or in improving the efficacy of ongoing ablation procedures.

We used wavefront field mapping to test the hypothesis that AF drivers, if concurrent, may interact to produce fluctuating areas of control to explain their appearance/disappearance and acute impact of ablation.METHODS: We recruited 54 patients from an international registry in whom persistent AF terminated by targeted ablation. Unipolar AF electrograms were analyzed from 64-pole baskets to reconstruct activation times, map propagation vectors each 20 ms, and create nonproprietary phase maps.RESULTS: Each patient (63.6\u00b18.5 years, 29.6% women) showed 4.0\u00b12.1 spatially anchored rotational or focal sites in AF in 3 patterns. First, a single (type I; n=7) or, second, paired chiral-antichiral (type II; n=5) rotational drivers controlled most of the atrial area. Ablation of 1 to 2 large drivers terminated all cases of types I or II AF. Third, interaction of 3 to 5 drivers (type III; n=42) with changing areas of control. Targeted ablation at driver centers terminated AF and required more ablation in types III versus I (P=0.02 in left atrium).CONCLUSIONS: Wavefront field mapping of persistent AF reveals a pathophysiologic network of a small number of spatially anchored rotational and focal sites, which interact, fluctuate, and control varying areas. Future work should define whether AF drivers that control larger atrial areas are attractive targets for ablation.

However, when used in clinical practice, panoramic AF maps generated from multipolar intracardiac electrograms have yielded conflicting results between centers, likely due to their complexity and steep learning curve, thus limiting the proper assessment of its clinical impact.The main purpose of this trial was to assess the impact of online training on the identification of AF driver sites where ablation terminated persistent AF, through a standardized training program. Extending this concept to mobile health was defined as a secondary objective.An online database of panoramic AF movies was generated from a multicenter registry of patients in whom targeted ablation terminated non-paroxysmal AF, using a freely available method (Kuklik et al-method A) and a commercial one (RhythmView-method B). Cardiology Fellows naive to AF mapping were enrolled and randomized to training vs no training (control). All participants evaluated an initial set of movies to identify sites of AF termination. Participants randomized to training evaluated a second set of movies in which they received feedback on their answers. Both groups re-evaluated the initial set to assess the impact of training. This concept was then migrated to a smartphone application (App).12 individuals (median age of 30 years (IQR 28-32), 6 females) read 480 AF maps. Baseline identification of AF termination sites by ablation was poor (40%\u00b112% vs 42%\u00b111%, P = 0.78), but similar for both mapping methods (P = 0.68). Training improved accuracy for both methods A (P = 0.001) and B (p = 0.012); whereas controls showed no change in accuracy (P = NS). The Smartphone App accessed AF maps from multiple systems on the cloud to recreate this training environment.Digital online training improved interpretation of panoramic AF maps in previously inexperienced clinicians. Combining online clinical data, smartphone apps and other digital resources provides a powerful, scalable approach for training in novel techniques in electrophysiology.

The goal of this study is to develop a measure for signal fidelity and to develop methods to quantify robustness of observed rotational activity in phase maps subject to signal contamination. Methods: We identified rotational activity in phase maps of human persistent AF using the Hilbert transform of sinusoidally recomposed signals, where localized ablation at rotational sites terminated fibrillation. A novel measure of signal fidelity was developed to quantify signal quality. Contamination is then introduced to the underlying electrograms by removing signals at random, adding noise to computations of cycle length, and adding realistic far-field signals. Mean tip number N and tip density \u03b4, defined as the proportion of time a region contains a tip, at the termination site are computed to compare the effects of contamination. Results: Domains of low signal fidelity correspond to the location of rotational cores. Removing signals and altering cycle length accounted for minor changes in tip density, while targeted removal of low fidelity electrograms can result in a significant increase in tip density and stability. Far-field contamination was found to obscure rotation at the termination site. Conclusion: Rotational activity in clinical AF can produce domains of low fidelity electrogram recordings at rotational cores. Observed rotational patterns in phase maps appear most sensitive to far-field activation. These results may inform novel methods to map AF in humans which can be tested directly in patients at electrophysiological study and ablation.

We hypothesized that putative AF drivers and disorganized zones may interact dynamically over short time scales. We studied this interaction over prolonged durations, focusing on regions where ablation terminates persistent AF using 2 mapping methods.We recruited 55 patients with persistent AF in whom ablation terminated AF prior to pulmonary vein isolation from a multicenter registry. AF was mapped globally using electrograms for 360\u00b145 cycles using (1) a published phase method and (2) a commercial activation/phase method.Patients were 62.2\u00b19.7 years, 76% male. Sites of AF termination showed rotational/focal patterns by methods 1 and 2 (51/55 vs 55/55; P=0.13) in spatially conserved regions, yet fluctuated over time. Time points with no AF driver showed competing drivers elsewhere or disordered waves. Organized regions were detected for 61.6\u00b123.9% and 70.6\u00b120.6% of 1 minute per method (P=nonsignificant), confirmed by automatic phase tracking (P<0.05). To detect AF drivers with >90% sensitivity, 8 to 32 s of AF recordings were required depending on driver definition.Sites at which persistent AF terminated by ablation show organized activation that fluctuate over time, because of collision from concurrent organized zones or fibrillatory waves, yet recur in conserved spatial regions. Results were similar by 2 mapping methods. This network of competing mechanisms should be reconciled with existing disorganized or driver mechanisms for AF, to improve clinical mapping and ablation of persistent AF.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Recent studies propose ablation of AF drivers improves outcomes over PVI, yet with conflicting reports in the literature. We undertook a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to determine outcomes from ablation of AF drivers in addition to PVI or as a stand-alone procedure.Database search was done using the terms atrial fibrillation and ablation or catheter ablation and driver or rotor or focal impulse or FIRM (Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation). We pooled data using random effects model and assessed heterogeneity with I2 statistic.Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria, in a cohort size of 3294 patients. Adding AF driver ablation to PVI reported freedom from AF of 72.5% (confidence interval [CI], 62.1%-81.8%; P<0.01) and from all arrhythmias of 57.8% (CI, 47.5%-67.7%; P<0.01). AF driver ablation when added to PVI or as stand-alone procedure compared with controls produced an odds ratio of 3.1 (CI, 1.3-7.7; P=0.02) for freedom from AF and an odds ratio of 1.8 (CI, 1.2-2.7; P<0.01) for freedom from all arrhythmias in 4 controlled studies. AF termination rate was 40.5% (CI, 30.6%-50.9%) and predicted favorable outcome from ablation(P<0.05).In controlled studies, the addition of AF driver ablation to PVI supports the possible benefit of a combined approach of AF driver ablation and PVI in improving single-procedure freedom from all arrhythmias. However, most studies are uncontrolled and are limited by substantial heterogeneity in outcomes. Large multicenter randomized trials are needed to precisely define the benefits of adding driver ablation to PVI. View details for PubMedID 29743170 The mechanisms by which persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) terminates via localized ablation are not well understood. To address the hypothesis that sites where localized ablation terminates persistent AF have characteristics identifiable with activation mapping during AF, we systematically examined activation patterns acquired only in cases of unequivocal termination by ablation.We recruited 57 patients with persistent AF undergoing ablation, in whom localized ablation terminated AF to sinus rhythm or organized tachycardia. For each site, we performed an offline analysis of unprocessed unipolar electrograms collected during AF from multipolar basket catheters using the maximum -dV/dt assignment to construct isochronal activation maps for multiple cycles. Additional computational modeling and phase analysis were used to study mechanisms of map variability. At all sites of AF termination, localized repetitive activation patterns were observed. Partial rotational circuits were observed in 26 of 57 (46%) cases, focal patterns in 19 of 57 (33%), and complete rotational activity in 12 of 57 (21%) cases. In computer simulations, incomplete segments of partial rotations coincided with areas of slow conduction characterized by complex, multicomponent electrograms, and variations in assigning activation times at such sites substantially altered mapped mechanisms.Local activation mapping at sites of termination of persistent AF showed repetitive patterns of rotational or focal activity. In computer simulations, complete rotational activation sequence was observed but was sensitive to assignment of activation timing particularly in segments of slow conduction. The observed phenomena of repetitive localized activation and the mechanism by which local ablation terminates putative AF drivers require further investigation. View details for PubMedID 29330332 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC5769709 One approach to improve ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is to focus on physiological targets including focal or rotational sources or ganglionic plexi (GP). However, the spatial relationship between these potential mechanisms has never been studied. We tested the hypothesis that rotors and focal sources for AF may co-localize with ganglionated plexi (GP).We prospectively identified locations of AF rotors and focal sources, and correlated these to GP sites in 97 consecutive patients (age 59.9\u00b111.4, 73% persistent AF). AF was recorded with 64-pole catheters with activation/phase mapping, and related to anatomic GP sites on electroanatomic maps.AF sources arose in 96/97 (99%) patients for 2.6\u00b11.4 sources per patient (left atrium: 1.7\u00b10.9 right atrium: 1.1\u00b10.8), each with an area of 2-3cm(2). On area analyses, the probability of an AF source randomly overlapping a GP area was 26%. Left atrial sources were seen in 94 (97%) patients, in whom \u22651 source co-localized with GP in 75 patients (80%; p<0.05). AF sources were more likely to colocalize with left vs right GPs (p<0.05), and colocalization was more likely in patients with higher CHADS2VASc scores (age>65, diabetes; p<0.05).This is the first study to demonstrate that clinically detected AF focal and rotational sources in the left atrium often colocalize with regions of autonomic innervation. Studies should define if the role of AF sources differs by their anatomical location. View details for DOI 10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.02.152 View details for PubMedID 28433558 The mechanisms for atrial fibrillation (AF) are unclear in part because diverse mapping techniques yield diverse maps, ranging from stable organized sources to highly disordered waves. We hypothesized that AF mechanisms may be clarified if mapping techniques were compared in the same patients, and referenced to a clinical endpoint. We compared two independent AF mapping techniques in patients in whom ablation terminated persistent AF before pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).We identified 12 patients with persistent AF (61.2 \u00b1 10.8 years, four female) in whom mapping with 64 pole baskets and technique 1 (activation/phase mapping, FIRM) identified rotational activation patterns during at least 50% of the 4-second mapping interval and targeted ablation at these rotational sites terminated AF to sinus rhythm (n = 10) or atrial tachycardia. We analyzed the unipolar electrograms of these patients to determine phase maps of activation by an independent technique 2 (Kuklik, Schotten et al., IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 2015). Compared to technique 1, technique 2 revealed a source in 12 of 12 (100%) cases with spatial concordance in all cases (P <0.05) and similar rotational characteristics.At sites where ablation terminated persistent AF, two independent mapping techniques identified stable rotational activation for multiple cycles that drove peripheral disorder. Future comparative studies referenced to a clinical endpoint may help reconcile if discrepancies between AF mapping studies reports represent techniques, patient populations or models of AF, and improve mapping to better guide ablation. View details for DOI 10.1111/jce.13177 View details for PubMedID 28185348 Atrial fibrillation (AF) often converts to and from atrial tachycardia (AT), but it is undefined if these rhythms are mechanistically related in such patients. We tested the hypothesis that critical sites for AT may be related to regional AF sources in patients with both rhythms, by mapping their locations and response to ablation on transitions to and from AF.From 219 patients undergoing spatial mapping of AF prior to ablation at 3 centers, we enrolled 26 patients in whom AF converted to AT by ablation (n=19) or spontaneously (n=7; left atrial size 42\u00b16cm, 38% persistent AF). Both atria were mapped in both rhythms by 64-electrode baskets, traditional activation maps and entrainment.Each patient had a single mapped AT (17 reentrant, 9 focal) and 3.7\u00b11.7 AF sources. The mapped AT spatially overlapped one AF source in 88% (23/26) of patients, in left (15/23) or right (8/23) atria. AF transitioned to AT by 3 mechanisms: (a) ablation anchoring AF rotor to AT (n=13); (b) residual, unablated AF source producing AT (n=6); (c) spontaneous slowing of AF rotor leaving reentrant AT at this site without any ablation (n=7). Electrogram analysis revealed a lower peak-to-peak voltage at overlapping sites (0.36\u00b10.2mV vs 0.49\u00b10.2mV p=0.03).Mechanisms responsible for AT and AF may arise in overlapping atrial regions. This mechanistic inter-relationship may reflect structural and/or functional properties in either atrium. Future work should delineate how acceleration of an organized AT may produce AF, and whether such regions can be targeted a priori to prevent AT recurrence post AF ablation.

Formally it scales as O(N4), where N is the number of Gaussian basis functions used to represent the molecular wave function. In practice, this scaling can be reduced to O(N2) or less by neglecting small integrals with screening methods. The contributions of the ERIs to the Fock matrix are of Coulomb (J) and exchange (K) type and require separate algorithms to compute matrix elements efficiently. We previously implemented highly efficient GPU-accelerated J-matrix and K-matrix algorithms in the electronic structure code TeraChem. Although these implementations supported the use of multiple GPUs on a node, they did not support the use of multiple nodes. This presents a key bottleneck to cutting-edge ab initio simulations of large systems, e.g., excited state dynamics of photoactive proteins. We present our implementation of multinode multi-GPU J- and K-matrix algorithms in TeraChem using the Regent programming language. Regent directly supports distributed computation in a task-based model and can generate code for a variety of architectures, including NVIDIA GPUs. We demonstrate multinode scaling up to 45 GPUs (3 nodes) and benchmark against hand-coded TeraChem integral code. We also outline our metaprogrammed Regent implementation, which enables flexible code generation for integrals of different angular momenta.

AEDT's critical role in regulatory compliance and evaluating the environmental impacts of aviation requires asking how accurate are its noise predictions. Previous studies suggest that AEDT's predictions lack desired accuracy. This paper reports on a large-scale study, using 200 000 flight trajectories paired with measured sound levels for arrivals to Runways 28L/28R at San Francisco International Airport, over 12 months. For each flight, two AEDT studies were run, one using the approved mode for regulatory filing and the other using an advanced non-regulatory mode with exact aircraft trajectories. AEDT's per aircraft noise predictions were compared with curated measured sound levels at two locations. On average, AEDT underestimated LAmax by -3.09dB and SEL by -2.04dB, combining the results from both AEDT noise-modeling modes. Discrepancies appear to result from limitations in the physical modeling of flight trajectories and noise generation, combined with input data uncertainties (aircraft weight, airspeed, thrust, and lift configuration) and atmospheric conditions.

Future transports must be 'cleaner' and designed to include technologies that will continue to lower engine emissions and reduce community noise. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will be critical to enable the design of these new concepts. In general, the ability to simulate aerodynamic and reactive flows using CFD has progressed rapidly during the past several decades and has fundamentally changed the aerospace design process. Advanced simulation capabilities not only enable reductions in ground-based and flight-testing requirements, but also provide added physical insight, and enable superior designs at reduced cost and risk. In spite of considerable success, reliable use of CFD has remained confined to a small region of the operating envelope due, in part, to the inability of current methods to reliably predict turbulent, separated flows. Fortunately, the advent of much more powerful computing platforms provides an opportunity to overcome a number of these challenges. This paper summarizes the findings and recommendations from a recent NASA-funded study that provides a vision for CFD in the year 2030, including an assessment of critical technology gaps and needed development, and identifies the key CFD technology advancements that will enable the design and development of much cleaner aircraft in the future.

    "bio": "I am a member of Dr. Jagjit Nanda's battery lab at the SLAC-Stanford Battery Center. My research primarily focuses on electrochemical performance of DRX-based lithium-ion batteries by optimizing slurry processing techniques for large-scale applications. Recently, chalcogenide perovskites, of the form ABX3, where typically A = alkaline earth metals Ca, Sr, or Ba; B = group IV transition metals Zr or Hf; and X = chalcogens S or Se, have become of interest for their potential optoelectronic properties. In this work, we build upon recent studies and show a general synthesis protocol, involving the use of carbon disulfide insertion chemistry, to generate highly reactive precursors that can be used towards the colloidal synthesis of numerous ABS3 nanomaterials, including BaTiS3, BaZrS3, BaHfS3, \u03b1-SrZrS3 and \u03b1-SrHfS3. We overcome the shortcomings in the current literature where BaZrS3 nanoparticles are synthesized in separate phases via colloidal methods and lack a reproducible protocol for orthorhombic perovskite nanoparticles. We present a high-temperature, hot-injection method that reliably controls the formation of the colloidal BaZrS3 nanoparticles with the Pnma orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure. We show that the alternate phase, most notably denoted by its extra peaks in the pXRD pattern, is distinct from the distorted perovskite phase as it has a different bandgap value obtained via UV-vis measurements. We also show that the reaction byproducts, resulting from the use of oleylamine and CS2, have their own photoluminescence (PL) and their residual presence on the surface of the nanoparticles complicates the interpretation of PL from the nanoparticles. The utility of these nanomaterials is also assessed via the measurement of their absorption properties and in the form of highly stable colloidal inks for the fabrication of homogeneous, crack-free thin films of BaZrS3 nanoparticles.

    "bio": "The human gut microbiota is a complex community comprising hundreds of species, with a few present in high abundance and the vast majority in low abundance. The biological functions and effects of these low-abundant species on their hosts are not yet fully understood. In this study, we assembled a bacterial consortium (SC-4) consisting of B. paravirosa, C. comes, M. indica, and A. butyriciproducens, which are low-abundant, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria isolated from healthy human gut, and tested its effect on host health using germ-free and human microbiota-associated colitis mouse models. The selection also favored these four bacteria being reduced in abundance in either Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) metagenome samples. Our findings demonstrate that SC-4 can colonize germ-free (GF) mice, increasing mucin thickness by activating MUC-1 and MUC-2 genes, thereby protecting GF mice from Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Moreover, SC-4 aided in the recovery of human microbiota-associated mice from DSS-induced colitis, and intriguingly, its administration enhanced the alpha diversity of the gut microbiome, shifting the community composition closer to control levels. The results showed enhanced phenotypes across all measures when the mice were supplemented with inulin as a dietary fiber source alongside SC-4 administration. We also showed a functional redundancy existing in the gut microbiome, resulting in the low abundant SCFA producers acting as a form of insurance, which in turn accelerates recovery from the dysbiotic state upon the administration of SC-4. SC-4 colonization also upregulated iNOS gene expression, further supporting its ability to produce an increasing number of goblet cells. Collectively, our results provide evidence that low-abundant SCFA-producing species in the gut may offer a novel therapeutic approach to IBD.

Such remote interactions have the potential to reduce pathogen exposure and use of personal protective equipment but may also pose new safety concerns given prior evidence that isolated patients can receive suboptimal care. Formal evaluations into the use and practical acceptance of inpatient telemedicine amongst hospitalized patients are lacking.We aimed to evaluate the experience of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with inpatient telemedicine introduced as an infection control measure during the pandemic.We conducted a qualitative evaluation in a COVID-19 designated non-intensive care hospital unit at a large academic health center (Stanford Health Care) October 2020 through January 2021. Semi-structured qualitative interviews focused on patient experience, impact on quality of care, communication, and mental health. Purposive sampling were used to recruit participants represent-ing diversity across varying demographics until thematic saturation was reached. Interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed using an inductive-deductive approach.Interviews with 20 hospitalized patients suggested non-emergency clinical care and bridging to in-person care comprised the majority of inpatient telemedicine use. Nurses were reported to enter the room and call on the tablet far more frequently than physicians, who typically entered the room at least daily. Patients reported broad acceptance of the technology, citing improved convenience and reduced anxiety but preferred in-person care where possible. Quality of care was believed to be similar to in-person care with the exception of a few patients who wanted more frequent in-person examinations. Ongoing challenges included low volume, shifting tablet location, and inconsistent verbal introductions from the clinical team.Patient experiences with in-patient telemedicine were largely favorable. Although most patients ex-pressed a preference for in-person care, telemedicine was acceptable given the circumstances asso-ciated with COVID-19. Technical and care team use improvements may enhance acceptability. Fur-ther evaluation is needed to understand the impact of inpatient telemedicine and the optimal balance between in-person and virtual care in the hospital setting.

In particular, my laboratory focuses on drug response at the molecular level, working in three areas. First, we are building a comprehensive pharmacogenomics knowledge base (http://www.pharmgkb.org/) that provides access to information relating genotype to phenotype (in particular, how variation in genetics leads to variation in response to drugs). We are interested in collaboratively discovering and applying new pharmacogenomics knowledge. Second, we are interested in the analysis of three dimensional biological structures. We have methods for analyzing protein structures to recognize and annotate active sites and binding sites, particularly in the context of interactions with small molecule drugs. We are also interested in physics-based simulation of biological structures to understand how their dynamics impact their function (http://simbios.stanford.edu/). Finally, we are interested in computational methods for analyzing functional genomics information. We use natural language processing techniques for extracting and summarizing information in the literature, chemoinformatics methods for understanding small molecule function, and machine learning & data mining techniques to understand the molecular responses to drugs. Adverse drug responses (ADRs) result in over 7,000 deaths annually. Pharmacogenomic studies have shown that many ADRs are partially attributable to genetics. However, emerging data suggest that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm) also contribute to this variance. Understanding the impact of DNA methylation on drug response may minimize ADRs and improve the personalization of drug regimens. In this work, we identify DNA methylation sites that likely impact drug response phenotypes for anticoagulant and cardiometabolic drugs. We use instrumental variable analysis to integrate genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics derived from electronic health records (EHRs) within the U.K. Biobank (UKBB) with methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) data from the Genetics of DNA Methylation Consortium (GoDMC). This approach allows us to achieve a robust sample size using the largest publicly available pharmacogenomic GWAS. For warfarin, we find 71 DNAm sites. Of those, 8 are near the gene VKORC1 and 48 are on chromosome 6 near the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene family. We also find 2 warfarin DNAm sites near the genes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. For statins, we identify 17 DNAm sites. Eight are near the APOB gene, which encodes a carrier protein for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We find no novel significant epigenetic results for metformin.

These biases reflect broader systemic discrimination in healthcare and risk marginalizing already disadvantaged groups. Existing methods for measuring implicit biases require controlled randomized testing and only capture individual attitudes rather than outcomes. However, the \"big-data\" revolution has led to the availability of large observational medical datasets, like EHRs and biobanks, that provide the opportunity to investigate discrepancies in patient health outcomes. In this work, we propose a causal inference approach to detect the effect of clinician implicit biases on patient outcomes in large-scale medical data. Specifically, our method uses proximal mediation to disentangle pathway-specific effects of a patient's sociodemographic attribute on a clinician's diagnosis decision. We test our method on real-world data from the UK Biobank. Our work can serve as a tool that initiates conversation and brings awareness to unequal health outcomes caused by implicit biases. View details for PubMedID 39670380 Protein Language Models (PLMs) use transformer architectures to capture patterns within protein primary sequences, providing a powerful computational representation of the amino acid sequence. Through large-scale training on protein primary sequences, PLMs generate vector representations that encapsulate the biochemical and structural properties of proteins. At the core of PLMs is the attention mechanism, which facilitates the capture of long-range dependencies by computing pairwise importance scores across residues, thereby highlighting regions of biological interaction within the sequence. The attention matrices offer an untapped opportunity to uncover specific biological properties of proteins, particularly their functions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, using the Evolutionary Scale Modelling (ESM) , for identifying High Attention (HA) sites within protein primary sequences, corresponding to key residues that define protein families. By examining attention patterns across multiple layers, we pinpoint residues that contribute most to family classification and function prediction. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a method for identifying HA sites at critical residues from the middle layers of the PLM; (2) we demonstrate that these HA sites provide interpretable links to biological functions; and (3) we show that HA sites improve active site predictions for functions of unannotated proteins. We make available the HA sites for the human proteome. This work offers a broadly applicable approach to protein classification and functional annotation and provides a biological interpretation of the PLM's representation.

While advances in machine learning techniques hold great potential to fill this annotation gap, current methods for function prediction are unable to associate global function reliably to the specific residues responsible for that function. We address this issue by introducing PARSE (Protein Annotation by Residue-Specific Enrichment), a knowledge-based method which combines pretrained embeddings of local structural environments with traditional statistical techniques to simultaneously predict function and provide residue-level annotations. For the task of predicting the catalytic function of enzymes, PARSE achieves comparable or superior global performance to state-of-the-art machine learning methods (F1 score [Formula: see text] 85%) while simultaneously annotating the specific residues involved in each function with much greater precision. Since it does not require supervised training, our method can make one-shot predictions for very rare functions and is not limited to a particular type of functional label (e.g. Enzyme Commission numbers or Gene Ontology codes). Finally, we leverage the AlphaFold Structure Database to perform functional annotation at a proteome scale. By applying PARSE to the dark proteome-predicted structures which cannot be classified into known structural families-we predict several bacterial metalloproteases. Each of these proteins shares a strongly conserved catalytic site despite highly divergent sequences and global folds, illustrating the value of local structure representations for new function discovery.

Meanwhile, despite their versatility and promise, large language models (LLMs) often lack domain-specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. We present CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent system to automate and enhance CRISPR-based gene-editing design and data analysis. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for complex task decomposition, decision-making and interactive human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration. This system incorporates domain expertise, retrieval techniques, external tools and a specialized LLM fine tuned with open-forum discussions among scientists. CRISPR-GPT assists users in selecting CRISPR systems, experiment planning, designing guide RNAs, choosing delivery methods, drafting protocols, designing assays and analysing data. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT by knocking out four genes with CRISPR-Cas12a in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line and epigenetically activating two genes using CRISPR-dCas9 in a human melanoma cell line. CRISPR-GPT enables fully AI-guided gene-editing experiment design and analysis across different modalities, validating its effectiveness as an AI co-pilot in genome engineering.

Such correspondences can help to shed light on functional relationships between proteins and identify conserved local structural features that lead to function. Self-supervised deep learning on large protein structure datasets has produced high-fidelity representations of local structural microenvironments, providing the opportunity to characterize the landscape of local structure and function at scale.In this work, we leverage these representations to cluster over 15 million environments in the Protein Data Bank, resulting in the creation of a \"lexicon\" of local 3D motifs which form the building blocks of all known protein structures. We characterize these motifs and demonstrate that they provide valuable information for modeling structure and function at all scales of protein analysis, from full protein chains to binding pockets to individual amino acids. We devise a new protein representation based solely on its constituent local motifs and show that this representation enables state-of-the-art performance on protein structure search and model quality assessment. We then show that this approach enables accurate prediction of drug off-target interactions by modeling the similarity between local binding pockets. Finally, we identify structural motifs associated with pathogenic variants in the human proteome by leveraging the predicted structures in the AlphaFold structure database.All code and cluster data are available at https://github.com/awfderry/collapse-motifs .Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

However, downstream machine learning models typically require fixed-length input vectors, necessitating a pooling method to compress the output matrix into a single vector representation of the entire protein. Traditional pooling methods often result in substantial information loss, impacting downstream task performance. We aim to develop a pooling method that produces more expressive general-purpose protein embedding vectors while offering biological interpretability.RESULTS: We introduce Pool PaRTI, a novel pooling method that leverages internal transformer attention matrices and PageRank to assign token importance weights. Our unsupervised and parameter-free approach consistently prioritizes residues experimentally annotated as critical for function, assigning them higher importance scores. Across four diverse protein machine learning tasks, Pool PaRTI enables significant performance gains in predictive performance. Additionally, it enhances interpretability by identifying biologically relevant regions without relying on explicit structural data or annotated training. To assess generalizability, we evaluated Pool PaRTI with two encoder-only protein language models, confirming its robustness across different models.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Pool PaRTI is implemented in Python with PyTorch and is available at github.com/Helix-Research-Lab/Pool_PaRTI.git.CONTACT AND SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Pool PaRTI sequence embeddings and residue importance values for all human proteins on UniProt are available at zenodo.org/records/15036725 for ESM2 and protBERT.

Responding to this evolving epidemic requires reliable and timely information. One source of data is social media platforms. We assessed the utility of Reddit data for surveillance, covering heroin, prescription, and synthetic drugs. We built a natural language processing pipeline to identify opioid-related content and created a cohort of 1,689,039 Reddit users, each assigned to a state based on their previous Reddit activity. We measured their opioid-related posts over time and compared rates against CDC overdose and NFLIS report rates. To simulate the real-world prediction of synthetic opioid overdose rates, we added near real-time Reddit data to a model relying on CDC mortality data with a typical 6-month reporting lag. Reddit data significantly improved the prediction accuracy of overdose rates. This work suggests that social media can help monitor drug epidemics.

However, medication-induced biomarker trajectories stemming from such records remain poorly studied. Here, we extract clinical and medication prescription data from EHRs and conduct GWAS and rare variant burden tests in the UK Biobank (discovery) and the All of Us program (replication) on ten cardiometabolic drug response outcomes including lipid response to statins, HbA1c response to metformin and blood pressure response to antihypertensives (N = 932-28,880). Our discovery analyses in participants of European ancestry recover previously reported pharmacogenetic signals at genome-wide significance level (APOE, LPA and SLCO1B1) and a novel rare variant association in GIMAP5 with HbA1c response to metformin. Importantly, these associations are treatment-specific and not associated with biomarker progression in medication-naive individuals. We also found polygenic risk scores to predict drug response, though they explained less than 2% of the variance. In summary, we present an EHR-based framework to study the genetics of drug response and systematically investigated the common and rare pharmacogenetic contribution to cardiometabolic drug response phenotypes in 41,732 UK Biobank and 14,277 All of Us participants.

However, long-term, prospective cohort studies often grapple with absent or evolving health-related outcomes. Here, we propose two methods, liability and meta, for conducting genome-wide association studies (GWASs) that leverage disease liabilities calculated from deep patient phenotyping. Analyzing 38 common traits in \u223c300,000 UK Biobank participants, we identified an increased number of loci in comparison to the number identified by the conventional case-control approach, and there were high replication rates in larger external GWASs. Further analyses confirmed the disease specificity of the genetic architecture; the meta method demonstrated higher robustness when phenotypes were imputed with low accuracy. Additionally, polygenic risk scores based on disease liabilities more effectively predicted newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 dataset, which were controls in the earlier 2019 dataset. Our findings demonstrate that integrating high-dimensional phenotypic data into deep neural networks enhances genetic association studies while capturing disease-relevant genetic architecture.

However, real-world medical datasets have limited patient diversity and cannot simulate hypothetical outcomes, both of which are necessary for equitable and effective medical research. Fueled by recent advancements in machine learning, generative models offer a promising solution to these data limitations by generating enhanced synthetic data. This review highlights the potential of conditional generative models (CGMs) to create patient-specific synthetic data for a variety of precision medicine applications. We survey CGM approaches that tackle two medical applications: correcting for data representation biases and simulating digital health twins. We additionally explore how the surveyed methods handle modeling tabular medical data and briefly discuss evaluation criteria. Finally, we summarize the technical, medical, and ethical challenges that must be addressed before CGMs can be effectively and safely deployed in the medical field.

We propose a multi-pronged framework for researchers to mitigate these risks, looking first to existing ethical frameworks and regulatory measures researchers can adapt to their own work, next to off-the-shelf AI solutions, then to design-specific solutions researchers can build into their AI to mitigate misuse. When researchers remain unable to address the potential for harmful misuse, and the risks outweigh potential benefits, we recommend researchers consider a different approach to answering their research question, or a new research question if the risks remain too great. We apply this framework to three different domains of AI research where misuse is likely to be problematic: (1) AI for drug and chemical discovery; (2) generative models for synthetic data; (3) ambient intelligence.

However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure-function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein-protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the Prosite database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites. These methods demonstrate that COLLAPSE is computationally efficient, tunable, and interpretable, providing a general-purpose platform for computational protein analysis.

We describe a method for phenotype recognition that imputes phenotype codes for all UK Biobank participants.POPDx (Population-based Objective Phenotyping by Deep Extrapolation) is a bilinear machine learning framework for simultaneously estimating the probabilities of 1538 phenotype codes. We extracted phenotypic and health-related information of 392 246 individuals from the UK Biobank for POPDx development and evaluation. A total of 12 803 ICD-10 diagnosis codes of the patients were converted to 1538 phecodes as gold standard labels. The POPDx framework was evaluated and compared to other available methods on automated multiphenotype recognition.POPDx can predict phenotypes that are rare or even unobserved in training. We demonstrate substantial improvement of automated multiphenotype recognition across 22 disease categories, and its application in identifying key epidemiological features associated with each phenotype.POPDx helps provide well-defined cohorts for downstream studies. It is a general-purpose method that can be applied to other biobanks with diverse but incomplete data.

In this work, we seek to understand how genes involved in pathogenesis which are often not associated with the immune system in an obvious way communicate with the immune system. We have embedded a network of human protein-protein interactions (PPI) from the STRING database with 14,707 human genes using feature learning that captures high confidence edges. We have found that our predicted Association Scores derived from the features extracted from STRING's high confidence edges are useful for predicting novel connections between genes, thus enabling the construction of a full map of predicted associations for all possible pairs between 14,707 human genes. In particular, we analyzed the pattern of associations for 126 cytokines and found that the six patterns of cytokine interaction with human genes are consistent with their functional classifications. To define the disease-specific roles of cytokines we have collected gene sets for 11,944 diseases from DisGeNET. We used these gene sets to predict disease-specific gene associations with cytokines by calculating the normalized average Association Scores between disease-associated gene sets and the 126 cytokines; this creates a unique profile of inflammatory genes (both known and predicted) for each disease. We validated our predicted cytokine associations by comparing them to known associations for 171 diseases. The predicted cytokine profiles correlate (p-value<0.0003) with the known ones in 95 diseases. We further characterized the profiles of each disease by calculating an \"Inflammation Score\" that summarizes different modes of immune responses. Finally, by analyzing subnetworks formed between disease-specific pathogenesis genes, hormones, receptors, and cytokines, we identified the key genes responsible for interactions between pathogenesis and inflammatory responses. These genes and the corresponding cytokines used by different immune disorders suggest unique targets for drug discovery.

The monitoring and analysis of the severity of ADRs is limited by the current qualitative and categorical systems of severity classification. Previous efforts have generated quantitative estimates for a subset of ADRs but were limited in scope because of the time and costs associated with the efforts.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to increase the number of ADRs for which there are quantitative severity estimates while improving the quality of these severity estimates.METHODS: We present a semisupervised approach that estimates ADR severity by using social media word embeddings to construct a lexical network of ADRs and perform label propagation. We used this method to estimate the severity of 28,113 ADRs, representing 12,198 unique ADR concepts from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.RESULTS: Our Severity of Adverse Events Derived from Reddit (SAEDR) scores have good correlations with real-world outcomes. The SAEDR scores had Spearman correlations of 0.595, 0.633, and -0.748 for death, serious outcome, and no outcome, respectively, with ADR case outcomes in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. We investigated different methods for defining initial seed term sets and evaluated their impact on the severity estimates. We analyzed severity distributions for ADRs based on their appearance in boxed warning drug label sections, as well as for ADRs with sex-specific associations. We found that ADRs discovered in the postmarketing period had significantly greater severity than those discovered during the clinical trial (P<.001). We created quantitative drug-risk profile (DRIP) scores for 968 drugs that had a Spearman correlation of 0.377 with drugs ranked by the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System cases resulting in death, where the given drug was the primary suspect.CONCLUSIONS: Our SAEDR and DRIP scores are well correlated with the real-world outcomes of the entities they represent and have demonstrated utility in pharmacovigilance research. We make the SAEDR scores for 12,198 ADRs and the DRIP scores for 968 drugs publicly available to enable more quantitative analysis of pharmacovigilance data.

However, joint analysis of datasets generated by independent labs remains challenging due to a lack of consistent terminology to describe cell types. Here, we present OnClass, an algorithm and accompanying software for automatically classifying cells into cell types that are part of the controlled vocabulary that forms the Cell Ontology. A key advantage of OnClass is its capability to classify cells into cell types not present in the training data because it uses the Cell Ontology graph to infer cell type relationships. Furthermore, OnClass can be used to identify marker genes for all the cell ontology categories, regardless of whether the cell types are present or absent in the training data, suggesting that OnClass goes beyond a simple annotation tool for single cell datasets, being the first algorithm capable to identify marker genes specific to all terms of the Cell Ontology and offering the possibility of refining the Cell Ontology using a data-centric approach.

Guidelines for selecting the right drug and right dose for patients based on their genetics are clinically effective, but are widely unused. For some drugs, the normal clinical decision making process may lead to the optimal dose of a drug that minimizes side effects and maximizes effectiveness. Without measurements of genotype, physicians and patients may adjust dosage in a manner that reflects the underlying genetics. The emergence of genetic data linked to longitudinal clinical data in large biobanks offers an opportunity to confirm known pharmacogenetic interactions as well as discover novel associations by investigating outcomes from normal clinical practice. Here we use the UK Biobank to search for pharmacogenetic interactions among 200 drugs and 9 genes among 200,000 participants. We identify associations between pharmacogene phenotypes and drug maintenance dose as well as differential drug response phenotypes. We find support for several known drug-gene associations as well as novel pharmacogenetic interactions.

The adoption of social media data has been hindered by the massive and noisy nature of the data. Initial attempts to use social media data have relied on exact text matches to drugs of interest, and therefore suffer from the gap between formal drug lexicons and the informal nature of social media. The Reddit comment archive represents an ideal corpus for bridging this gap. We trained a word embedding model, RedMed, to facilitate the identification and retrieval of health entities from Reddit data. We compare the performance of our model trained on a consumer-generated corpus against publicly available models trained on expert-generated corpora. Our automated classification pipeline achieves an accuracy of 0.88 and a specificity of > 0.9 across four different term classes. Of all drug mentions, an average of 79% (\u00b10.5%) were exact matches to a generic or trademark drug name, 14% (\u00b10.5%) were misspellings, 6.4% (\u00b10.3%) were synonyms, and 0.13% (\u00b10.05%) were pill marks. We find that our system captures an additional 20% of mentions; these would have been missed by approaches that rely solely on exact string matches. We provide a lexicon of misspellings and synonyms for 2,978 drugs and a word embedding model trained on a health-oriented subset of Reddit.

Data-driven methods hold promise for systematically deriving rules underlying the relationship between protein structure and function. However, the choice of protein structural representation is critical. Pre-defined biochemical features emphasize certain aspects of protein properties while ignoring others, and therefore may fail to capture critical information in complex protein sites.RESULTS: In this paper, we present a general framework that applies 3D convolutional neural networks (3DCNNs) to structure-based protein functional site detection. The framework can extract task-dependent features automatically from the raw atom distributions. We benchmarked our method against other methods and demonstrate better or comparable performance for site detection. Our deep 3DCNNs achieved an average recall of 0.955 at a precision threshold of 0.99 on PROSITE families, detected 98.89 and 92.88% of nitric oxide synthase and TRYPSIN-like enzyme sites in Catalytic Site Atlas, and showed good performance on challenging cases where sequence motifs are absent but a function is known to exist. Finally, we inspected the individual contributions of each atom to the classification decisions and show that our models successfully recapitulate known 3D features within protein functional sites.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The 3DCNN models described in this paper are available at https://simtk.org/projects/fscnn.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. View details for PubMedID 31051039 Accurate determination of target-ligand interactions is crucial in the drug discovery process. In this paper, we propose a graph-convolutional (Graph-CNN) framework for predicting protein-ligand interactions. First, we built an unsupervised graph-autoencoder to learn fixed-size representations of protein pockets from a set of representative druggable protein binding sites. Second, we trained two Graph-CNNs to automatically extract features from pocket graphs and 2D ligand graphs, respectively, driven by binding classification labels. We demonstrate that graph-autoencoders can learn fixed-size representations for protein pockets of varying sizes and the Graph-CNN framework can effectively capture protein-ligand binding interactions without relying on target-ligand complexes. Across several metrics, Graph-CNNs achieved better or comparable performance to 3DCNN ligand-scoring, AutoDock Vina, RF-Score, and NNScore on common virtual screening benchmark data sets. Visualization of key pocket residues and ligand atoms contributing to the classification decisions confirms that our networks are able to detect important interface residues and ligand atoms within the pockets and ligands, respectively.

This activity is mediated by interaction with the taxane site of beta-tubulin, leading to microtubule stabilization and cell death. Although widely used in the treatment of breast cancer and other malignancies, existing taxane-based therapies including paclitaxel and the second-generation docetaxel are currently limited by severe adverse effects and dose-limiting toxicity. To discover taxane site modulators, we employ a computational binding site similarity screen of > 14,000 drug-like pockets from PDB, revealing an unexpected similarity between the estrogen receptor and the beta-tubulin taxane binding pocket. Evaluation of nine selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) via cellular and biochemical assays confirms taxane site interaction, microtubule stabilization, and cell proliferation inhibition. Our study demonstrates that SERMs can modulate microtubule assembly and raises the possibility of an estrogen receptor-independent mechanism for inhibiting cell proliferation.

Many adverse events are not detected during clinical trials before a drug receives approval for use in the clinic. Fortunately, as part of postmarketing surveillance, regulatory agencies and other institutions maintain large collections of adverse event reports, and these databases present an opportunity to study drug effects from patient population data. However, confounding factors such as concomitant medications, patient demographics, patient medical histories, and reasons for prescribing a drug often are uncharacterized in spontaneous reporting systems, and these omissions can limit the use of quantitative signal detection methods used in the analysis of such data. Here, we present an adaptive data-driven approach for correcting these factors in cases for which the covariates are unknown or unmeasured and combine this approach with existing methods to improve analyses of drug effects using three test data sets. We also present a comprehensive database of drug effects (Offsides) and a database of drug-drug interaction side effects (Twosides). To demonstrate the biological use of these new resources, we used them to identify drug targets, predict drug indications, and discover drug class interactions. We then corroborated 47 (P < 0.0001) of the drug class interactions using an independent analysis of electronic medical records. Our analysis suggests that combined treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thiazides is associated with significantly increased incidence of prolonged QT intervals. We conclude that confounding effects from covariates in observational clinical data can be controlled in data analyses and thus improve the detection and prediction of adverse drug effects and interactions.

We aimed to undertake an integrated analysis of a complete human genome in a clinical context.We assessed a patient with a family history of vascular disease and early sudden death. Clinical assessment included analysis of this patient's full genome sequence, risk prediction for coronary artery disease, screening for causes of sudden cardiac death, and genetic counselling. Genetic analysis included the development of novel methods for the integration of whole genome and clinical risk. Disease and risk analysis focused on prediction of genetic risk of variants associated with mendelian disease, recognised drug responses, and pathogenicity for novel variants. We queried disease-specific mutation databases and pharmacogenomics databases to identify genes and mutations with known associations with disease and drug response. We estimated post-test probabilities of disease by applying likelihood ratios derived from integration of multiple common variants to age-appropriate and sex-appropriate pre-test probabilities. We also accounted for gene-environment interactions and conditionally dependent risks.Analysis of 2.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 752 copy number variations showed increased genetic risk for myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. We discovered rare variants in three genes that are clinically associated with sudden cardiac death-TMEM43, DSP, and MYBPC3. A variant in LPA was consistent with a family history of coronary artery disease. The patient had a heterozygous null mutation in CYP2C19 suggesting probable clopidogrel resistance, several variants associated with a positive response to lipid-lowering therapy, and variants in CYP4F2 and VKORC1 that suggest he might have a low initial dosing requirement for warfarin. Many variants of uncertain importance were reported.Although challenges remain, our results suggest that whole-genome sequencing can yield useful and clinically relevant information for individual patients.National Institute of General Medical Sciences; National Heart, Lung And Blood Institute; National Human Genome Research Institute; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; National Library of Medicine, Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health; Hewlett Packard Foundation; Breetwor Family Foundation.

All of Us offers an opportunity to discover novel correlations between drug dosage and genetic variation. However, first it is necessary to evaluate the quality and quantity of the data and its ability to replicate known associations. In this paper, we investigate whether known drug-gene interactions can be recovered from the All of Us dataset, based on data from electronic health records. Focusing on the Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme family, which metabolizes approximately 90% of clinically available drugs, we evaluate 61 drugs metabolized by the enzymes. We then identify significant differences in drug dosages across CYP450 metabolizer phenotypes. Our results validate some known interactors of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A5. However, we did not recover all validated PGx interactions, potentially due to noise, lack of doctors adjusting drug dosage or phenoconversion. Nevertheless, our findings highlight the potential of the All of Us dataset, which captures some known pharmacogenomic interactions.

In resource-constrained settings, such as Africa, where access to quality care remains a challenge, AI has the potential to improve efficiency, accessibility, and patient outcomes. Yet, its development and deployment raise complex ethical, legal, ecological, and socioeconomic concerns. To ensure context-sensitive solutions, this paper introduces Ubuntu, a traditional African ethical philosophy, as a guiding framework for AI in African healthcare. Ubuntu offers a people-centered alternative to dominant Western-centric models, providing a culturally grounded lens for interpreting justice-related principles in line with Africa's unique needs and realities. Drawing on Ubuntu's five core values of communalism, interdependence, humanism, sharing, and compassion, we analyze how these principles can ethically guide AI across three normative pillars: justice and fairness, solidarity, and sustainability. For each, we identify risks and offer concrete, culturally resonant strategies to address them. In doing so, we undertake a distinctive scholarly contribution that meaningfully enriches the emerging discourse on decolonizing AI by reframing Ubuntu not only as a moral compass but also as a strategic tool for structural reform and innovation.

Using the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) approach, we systematically targeted human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2, thus identifying unrecognized host factors that may facilitate viral entry. Validation experiments with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 confirmed the role of newly identified host factors, particularly the endo-lysosomal protease legumain (LGMN) and the potassium channel KCNA6, upon exogenous overexpression. In orthogonal experiments, we show that disruption of endogenous LGMN or KCNA6 decreases viral infection and that inhibitors of candidate factors can reduce viral entry. Additionally, using clinical data, we find possible associations between expression of either LGMN or KCNA6 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in human tissues. Our results identify potentially druggable host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, and demonstrate the utility of focused, membrane-wide CRISPRa screens in uncovering tissue-specific entry factors of emerging pathogens.

Autosomal-dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1) is a rare genetic form of hypoparathyroidism caused by gain-of-function (GoF) variants in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) encoded by CASR. We examined the prevalence, penetrance, and expressivity of GoF CASR variants in the UK Biobank (UKB; n = 433,793), All of Us (AOU; n = 229,987), and Mass General Brigham Biobank (n = 39,081). Individuals with previously reported ADH1-associated variants indeed showed ADH1 symptoms, including hypocalcemia (60% in the UKB and 78% in AOU). However, less than half had an ADH1-relevant diagnosis code (17% in the UKB and 44% in AOU), suggesting that individuals with ADH1 are present in these biobanks but may be underdiagnosed. We then developed a scoring algorithm and identified nine low-frequency ADH1-associated variants, which were further validated using genetic sequencing of individuals with nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism (n = 169) and an in vitro functional assay. These nine variants have an intermediate effect and frequency relative to previously reported ADH1-associated variants, completing an allelic series with respect to serum calcium, and alone are responsible for a symptom burden roughly equivalent to all previously reported ADH1-associated variants. Our work indicates that hypocalcemia due to GoF in CASR with ADH1-associated symptoms is underdiagnosed, provides a deeper understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship of CASR variants, and illustrates that variants in genes underlying rare disorders may cause a much greater symptom burden than currently appreciated.

We propose Semi-Supervised Data-Integrated Feature Importance (DIFI), a method that numerically integrates a priori knowledge, represented as a sparse knowledge map, into the model's feature weighting. By incorporating the similarity between the knowledge map and the feature map into a loss function, DIFI causes the model's feature weighting to correlate with the knowledge.We show that DIFI can improve the performance of neural networks using two biological tasks. In the first task, cancer type prediction from gene expression profiles was guided by identities of cancer type-specific biomarkers. In the second task, enzyme/non-enzyme classification from protein sequences was guided by the locations of the catalytic residues. In both tasks, DIFI leads to improved performance and feature weighting that is interpretable. DIFI is a novel method for injecting knowledge to achieve model alignment and interpretability.Code and models for our experiments are available at https://github.com/junwkim1/DIFI.

Pharmacogenomic studies have shown that many ADRs are partially attributable to genetics. However, emerging data suggest that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm) also contribute to this variance. Understanding the impact of DNA methylation on drug response may minimize ADRs and improve the personalization of drug regimens. In this work, we identify DNA methylation sites that likely impact drug response phenotypes for anticoagulant and cardiometabolic drugs. We use instrumental variable analysis to integrate genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics derived from electronic health records (EHRs) within the U.K. Biobank (UKBB) with methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) data from the Genetics of DNA Methylation Consortium (GoDMC). This approach allows us to achieve a robust sample size using the largest publicly available pharmacogenomic GWAS. For warfarin, we find 71 DNAm sites. Of those, 8 are near the gene VKORC1 and 48 are on chromosome 6 near the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene family. We also find 2 warfarin DNAm sites near the genes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. For statins, we identify 17 DNAm sites. Eight are near the APOB gene, which encodes a carrier protein for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We find no novel significant epigenetic results for metformin.

These biases reflect broader systemic discrimination in healthcare and risk marginalizing already disadvantaged groups. Existing methods for measuring implicit biases require controlled randomized testing and only capture individual attitudes rather than outcomes. However, the \"big-data\" revolution has led to the availability of large observational medical datasets, like EHRs and biobanks, that provide the opportunity to investigate discrepancies in patient health outcomes. In this work, we propose a causal inference approach to detect the effect of clinician implicit biases on patient outcomes in large-scale medical data. Specifically, our method uses proximal mediation to disentangle pathway-specific effects of a patient's sociodemographic attribute on a clinician's diagnosis decision. We test our method on real-world data from the UK Biobank. Our work can serve as a tool that initiates conversation and brings awareness to unequal health outcomes caused by implicit biases.

However, downstream machine learning models typically require fixed-length input vectors, necessitating a pooling method to compress the output matrix into a single vector representation of the entire protein. Traditional pooling methods often result in substantial information loss, impacting downstream task performance. We aim to develop a pooling method that produces more expressive general-purpose protein embedding vectors while offering biological interpretability.We introduce Pool PaRTI, a novel pooling method that leverages internal transformer attention matrices and PageRank to assign token importance weights. Our unsupervised and parameter-free approach consistently prioritizes residues experimentally annotated as critical for function, assigning them higher importance scores. Across four diverse protein machine learning tasks, Pool PaRTI enables significant performance gains in predictive performance. Additionally, it enhances interpretability by identifying biologically relevant regions without relying on explicit structural data or annotated training. To assess generalizability, we evaluated Pool PaRTI with two encoder-only protein language models, confirming its robustness across different models.Pool PaRTI is implemented in Python with PyTorch and is available at https://github.com/Helix-Research-Lab/Pool_PaRTI.git.

Colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) are seldom eradicated by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cancer cells with stem-like functional properties, often referred to as \"cancer stem cells\" (CSCs), display preferential resistance to several anti-tumor agents used in cancer chemotherapy, but the molecular mechanisms underpinning their selective survival remain only partially understood. Methods. In this study, we used Transcription Factor Target Genes (TFTG) enrichment analysis to identify transcriptional regulators (activators or repressors) that undergo preferential activation by chemotherapy in CRC cells with a \"bottom-of-the-crypt\" phenotype (EPCAM + /CD44 + /CD166 + ; CSC-enriched) as compared to CRC cells with a \"top-of-the-crypt\" phenotype (EPCAM + /CD44 neg /CD166 neg ; CSC-depleted). The two cell populations were purified in parallel by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) line representative of a moderately differentiated human CRC, following in vivo chemotherapy with irinotecan (CPT-11). The transcriptional regulators identified as differentially activated were tested for differential expression in normal vs. cancer tissues, and in cell populations enriched in stem/progenitor cell-types as compared to differentiated lineages (goblet cells, enterocytes) in the mouse colon epithelium. Finally, the top candidate was tested for mechanistic contribution to drug-resistance by selective down-regulation using short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Results. Our analysis identified E2F4 and TFDP1, two core components of the DREAM transcriptional repression complex, as transcriptional modulators preferentially activated by irinotecan in EPCAM + /CD44 + /CD166 + as compared to EPCAM + /CD44 neg /CD166 neg cancer cells. The expression levels of both genes ( E2F4 , TFDP1 ) were found up-regulated in CRCs as compared to human normal colon tissues, and in a sub-population of mouse colon epithelial cells enriched in stem/progenitor elements (Epcam + /Cd44 + /Cd66a low /Kit neg ) as compared to other sub-populations enriched in either goblet cells (Epcam + /Cd44 + /Cd66a low /Kit + ) or enterocytes (Epcam + /Cd44 neg /Cd66a high ). Most importantly, E2F4 down-regulation using shRNAs dramatically enhanced the sensitivity of human CRCs to in vivo treatment with irinotecan , across three independent PDX models. Conclusions. Our data identified E2F4 and the DREAM repressor complex as critical regulators of human CRC resistance to irinotecan , and as candidate targets for the development of chemo-sensitizing agents.

Current methods for feature attribution, which rely on \"explaining\" the predictions of end-to-end classifiers, suffer from imprecise feature localization and are inadequate for use with small sample sizes and high-dimensional datasets due to computational challenges. We introduce prospector heads, an efficient and interpretable alternative to explanation-based attribution methods that can be applied to any encoder and any data modality. Prospector heads generalize across modalities through experiments on sequences (text), images (pathology), and graphs (protein structures), outperforming baseline attribution methods by up to 26.3 points in mean localization AUPRC. We also demonstrate how prospector heads enable improved interpretation and discovery of class-specific patterns in input data.

Creating knowledge graph representations of interacting drugs, diseases, genes, and proteins enables discovery via embedding-based ML approaches and link prediction. Previously, it has been shown that these predictive methods are susceptible to biases from network structure, namely that they are driven not by discovering nuanced biological understanding of mechanisms, but based on high-degree hub nodes. In this work, we study the confounding effect of network topology on biological relation semantics by creating an experimental pipeline of knowledge graph semantic and topological perturbations. We show that the drop in drug repurposing performance from ablating meaningful semantics increases by 21% and 38% when mitigating topological bias in two networks. We demonstrate that new methods for representing knowledge and inferring new knowledge must be developed for making use of biomedical semantics for pharmacological innovation, and we suggest fruitful avenues for their development.

As an emerging paradigm in drug development, drug repurposing enables more efficient treatment of rare diseases, stratified patient populations, and urgent threats to public health. However, prioritizing well-suited drug candidates from among a nearly infinite number of repurposing options continues to represent a significant challenge in drug development. Over the past decade, advances in genomic profiling, database curation, and machine learning techniques have enabled more accurate identification of drug repurposing candidates for subsequent clinical evaluation. This review outlines the major methodologic classes that these approaches comprise, which rely on (a) protein structure, (b) genomic signatures, (c) biological networks, and (d) real-world clinical data. We propose that realizing the full impact of drug repurposing methodologies requires a multidisciplinary understanding of each method's advantages and limitations with respect to clinical practice.

However, medication-induced biomarker trajectories stemming from such records remain poorly studied. Here, we extract clinical and medication prescription data from EHRs and conduct GWAS and rare variant burden tests in the UK Biobank (discovery) and the All of Us program (replication) on ten cardiometabolic drug response outcomes including lipid response to statins, HbA1c response to metformin and blood pressure response to antihypertensives (N = 740-26,669). Our findings at genome-wide significance level recover previously reported pharmacogenetic signals and also include novel associations for lipid response to statins (N = 26,669) near LDLR and ZNF800. Importantly, these associations are treatment-specific and not associated with biomarker progression in medication-naive individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals with higher genetically determined low-density and total cholesterol baseline levels experience increased absolute, albeit lower relative biomarker reduction following statin treatment. In summary, we systematically investigated the common and rare pharmacogenetic contribution to cardiometabolic drug response phenotypes in over 50,000 UK Biobank and All of Us participants with EHR and identified clinically relevant genetic predictors for improved personalized treatment strategies.

The five complete editions of the CAGI community experiment comprised 50 challenges, in which participants made blind predictions of phenotypes from genetic data, and these were evaluated by independent assessors.Performance was particularly strong for clinical pathogenic variants, including some difficult-to-diagnose cases, and extends to interpretation of cancer-related variants. Missense variant interpretation methods were able to estimate biochemical effects with increasing accuracy. Assessment of methods for regulatory variants and complex trait disease risk was less definitive and indicates performance potentially suitable for auxiliary use in the clinic.Results show that while current methods are imperfect, they have major utility for research and clinical applications. Emerging methods and increasingly large, robust datasets for training and assessment promise further progress ahead.

Here, we discover a connection between these two metals at the mitochondria. Elevation of iron levels causes inward mitochondrial Ca2+ overflow, through an interaction of Fe2+ with mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). In PD neurons, iron accumulation-triggered Ca2+ influx across the mitochondrial surface leads to spatially confined Ca2+ elevation at the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is subsequently sensed by Miro1, a Ca2+-binding protein. A Miro1 blood test distinguishes PD patients from controls and responds to drug treatment. Miro1-based drug screens in PD cells discover Food and Drug Administration-approved T-type Ca2+-channel blockers. Human genetic analysis reveals enrichment of rare variants in T-type Ca2+-channel subtypes associated with PD status. Our results identify a molecular mechanism in PD pathophysiology and drug targets and candidates coupled with a convenient stratification method.

A total of 2,221 noncoding variants connected to risk for ten neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia, were studied in developing human neural cells. Integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic data with massively parallel reporter assays identified differentially-active single-nucleotide variants (daSNVs) in specific neural cell types. Expression-gene mapping, network analyses and chromatin looping nominated candidate disease-relevant target genes modulated by these daSNVs. Follow-up integration of daSNV gene editing with clinical cohort analyses suggested that magnesium transport dysfunction may increase neuropsychiatric disease risk and indicated that common genetic pathomechanisms may mediate specific symptoms that are shared across multiple neuropsychiatric diseases.

While advances in machine learning techniques hold great potential to fill this annotation gap, current methods for function prediction are unable to associate global function reliably to the specific residues responsible for that function. We address this issue by introducing PARSE (Protein Annotation by Residue-Specific Enrichment), a knowledge-based method which combines pre-trained embeddings of local structural environments with traditional statistical techniques to identify enriched functions with residue-level explainability. For the task of predicting the catalytic function of enzymes, PARSE achieves comparable or superior global performance to state-of-the-art machine learning methods (F1 score > 85%) while simultaneously annotating the specific residues involved in each function with much greater precision. Since it does not require supervised training, our method can make one-shot predictions for very rare functions and is not limited to a particular type of functional label (e.g. Enzyme Commission numbers or Gene Ontology codes). Finally, we leverage the AlphaFold Structure Database to perform functional annotation at a proteome scale. By applying PARSE to the dark proteome-predicted structures which cannot be classified into known structural families-we predict several novel bacterial metalloproteases. Each of these proteins shares a strongly conserved catalytic site despite highly divergent sequences and global folds, illustrating the value of local structure representations for new function discovery.

Given their dense phenotype data, biobanks can also facilitate replication studies on a phenome-wide scale. Here, we introduce the phenotype-genotype reference map (PGRM), a set of 5,879 genetic associations from 523 GWAS publications that can be used for high-throughput replication experiments. PGRM phenotypes are standardized as phecodes, ensuring interoperability between biobanks. We applied the PGRM to five ancestry-specific cohorts from four independent biobanks and found evidence of robust replications across a wide array of phenotypes. We show how the PGRM can be used to detect data corruption and to empirically assess parameters for phenome-wide studies. Finally, we use the PGRM to explore factors associated with replicability of GWAS results.

Incorporating key biological context such as cell type or tissue of action into representations of extracted biomedical knowledge is essential for principled pharmacological discovery. Existing global, literature-derived knowledge graphs of interactions between drugs, proteins, genes, and diseases lack this essential information. In this study, we frame the task of associating biological context with protein-protein interactions extracted from text as a classification task using syntactic, semantic, and novel meta-discourse features. We introduce the Insider corpora, which are automatically generated PubMed-scale corpora for training classifiers for the context association task. These corpora are created by searching for precise syntactic cues of cell type and tissue relevancy to extracted regulatory relations. We report F1 scores of 0.955 and 0.862 for identifying relevant cell types and tissues, respectively, for our identified relations. By classifying with this framework, we demonstrate that the problem of context association can be addressed using intuitive, interpretable features. We demonstrate the potential of this approach to enrich text-derived knowledge bases with biological detail by incorporating cell type context into a protein-protein network for dengue fever.

Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests a relationship between corneal structural features and anthropometric measures. We used global and local genetic similarity analysis to identify genomic features that may underlie structural corneal dysfunction.Methods: We assembled genome-wide association study summary statistics for corneal features (central corneal thickness, corneal hysteresis [CH], corneal resistance factor [CRF], and the 3 mm index of keratometry) and anthropometric traits (body mass index, weight, and height) in Europeans. We calculated global genetic correlations (rg) between traits using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and local genetic covariance using rho-HESS, which partitions the genome and performs regression with LD regions. Finally, we identified genes located within regions of significant genetic covariance and analyzed patterns of tissue expression and pathway enrichment.Results: Global LD score regression revealed significant negative correlations between height and both CH (rg = -0.12; P = 2.0 * 10-7) and CRF (rg = -0.11; P = 6.9 * 10-7). Local analysis revealed 68 genomic regions exhibiting significant local genetic covariance between CRF and height, containing 2874 unique genes. Pathway analysis of genes in regions with significant local rg revealed enrichment among signaling pathways with known keratoconus associations, including cadherin and Wnt signaling, as well as enrichment of genes modulated by copper and zinc ions.Conclusions: Corneal biophysical parameters and height share a common genomic architecture, which may facilitate identification of disease-associated genes and therapies for corneal ectasias.Translational Relevance: Local genetic covariance analysis enables the identification of associated genes and therapeutic targets for corneal ectatic disease.

We use our results to guide a propensity-score-matched, retrospective cohort study of 64,349 COVID-19 patients, showing that a top candidate drug, spironolactone, is associated with improved clinical prognosis, measured by intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation rates. Finally, we show that spironolactone exerts a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on viral entry in human lung epithelial cells. Our RxGRID method presents a computational framework, implemented as an open-source software package, enabling genomics researchers to identify drugs likely to modulate a molecular phenotype of interest based on high-throughput screening data. Our results, derived from this method and supported by experimental and clinical analysis, add additional supporting evidence for a potential protective role of the potassium-sparing diuretic spironolactone in severe COVID-19.

The images were split into training (n=1,340), validation (n=167), and test (n=165) datasets. Two state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms based on either object-level detection or image-level classification were trained on the dataset. These models were compared to one another and against two independent glaucoma specialists. We evaluated model performance by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). AUCs were compared with the Hanley-McNeil method.The object detection model achieved an AUC of 0.936 (95% CI: 0.857-0.964) across all held-out images (n=165 photos) which was significantly superior to the image classification model (AUC; 0.845 (95% CI: 0.740-0.912; p=0.006). At an operating point selected for high specificity, the model achieved a specificity of 94.3% and a sensitivity of 70.0%, which was statistically indistinguishable from an expert clinician (p=0.7). At an operating point selected for high sensitivity, the model achieves a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of 73.3%.An autonomous object detection model is superior to an image classification model for detecting disc hemorrhages and performed comparably to 2 clinicians.

We aimed to measure the effect of spironolactone use on the risk of adverse outcomes following COVID-19 hospitalization.Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 outcomes for patients with or without exposure to spironolactone, using population-scale claims data from the Komodo Healthcare Map. We identified all patients with a hospital admission for COVID-19 in the study window, defining treatment status based on spironolactone prescription orders. The primary outcomes were progression to respiratory ventilation or mortality during the hospitalization. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated following either 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) or multivariable regression. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant.Findings: Among 898,303 eligible patients with a COVID-19-related hospitalization, 16,324 patients (1.8%) had a spironolactone prescription prior to hospitalization. 59,937 patients (6.7%) met the ventilation endpoint, and 26,515 patients (3.0%) met the mortality endpoint. Spironolactone use was associated with a significant reduction in odds of both ventilation (OR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.75-0.88; p < 0.001) and mortality (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78-0.99; p = 0.033) in the PSM analysis, supported by the regression analysis. Spironolactone use was associated with significantly reduced odds of ventilation for all age groups, men, women, and non-obese patients, with the greatest protective effects in younger patients, men, and non-obese patients.Interpretation: Spironolactone use was associated with a protective effect against ventilation and mortality following COVID-19 infection, amounting to up to 64% of the protective effect of vaccination against ventilation and consistent with an androgen-dependent mechanism. The findings warrant initiation of large-scale randomized controlled trials to establish a potential therapeutic role for spironolactone in COVID-19 patients.

A key step in combating drug abuse is detecting, monitoring, and characterizing its trends over time and location, also known as pharmacovigilance. While federal reporting systems accomplish this to a degree, they often have high latency and incomplete coverage. Social-media-based pharmacovigilance has zero latency, is easily accessible and unfiltered, and benefits from drug users being willing to share their experiences online pseudo-anonymously. However, unlike highly structured official data sources, social media text is rife with misspellings and slang, making automated analysis difficult. Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a large autoregressive language model specialized for few-shot learning that was trained on text from the entire internet. We demonstrate that GPT-3 can be used to generate slang and common misspellings of terms for drugs of abuse. We repeatedly queried GPT-3 for synonyms of drugs of abuse and filtered the generated terms using automated Google searches and cross-references to known drug names. When generated terms for alprazolam were manually labeled, we found that our method produced 269 synonyms for alprazolam, 221 of which were new discoveries not included in an existing drug lexicon for social media. We repeated this process for 98 drugs of abuse, of which 22 are widely-discussed drugs of abuse, building a lexicon of colloquial drug synonyms that can be used for pharmacovigilance on social media.

This paradigm restricts the analysis to concepts that are known and well-characterized. Here, we present the novel multilingual translation method BioTranslator to address this problem. BioTranslator takes a user-written textual description of a new concept and then translates this description to a non-text biological data instance. The key idea of BioTranslator is to develop a multilingual translation framework, where multiple modalities of biological data are all translated to text. We demonstrate how BioTranslator enables the identification of novel cell types using only a textual description and how BioTranslator can be further generalized to protein function prediction and drug target identification. Our tool frees scientists from limiting their analyses within predefined controlled vocabularies, enabling them to interact with biological data using free text.

Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of hepatocytes and hepatic non-parenchymal cells to map the lipid signatures in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We uncover previously unidentified clusters of hepatocytes characterized by either high or low srebp1 expression. Surprisingly, the canonical lipid synthesis driver Srebp1 is not predictive of hepatic lipid accumulation, suggestive of other drivers of lipid metabolism. By combining transcriptional data at single-cell resolution with computational network analyses, we find that NAFLD is associated with high constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) expression. Mechanistically, CAR interacts with four functional modules: cholesterol homeostasis, bile acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and estrogen response. Nuclear expression of CAR positively correlates with steatohepatitis in human livers. These findings demonstrate significant cellular differences in lipid signatures and identify functional networks linked to hepatic steatosis in mice and humans.

However, the health-related outcome or disease status of participants in long-term, prospective cohort studies such as the UK Biobank are subject to change. Here, we develop an approach for the genetic association study leveraging disease liabilities computed from a deep patient phenotyping framework (AI-based liability). Analyzing 44 common traits in 261,807 participants from the UK Biobank, we identified novel loci compared to the conventional case-control (CC) association studies. Our results showed that combining liability scores with CC status was more powerful than the CC-GWAS in detecting independent genetic loci across different diseases. This boost in statistical power was further reflected in increased SNP-based heritability estimates. Moreover, polygenic risk scores calculated from AI-based liabilities better identified newly diagnosed cases in the 2022 release of the UK Biobank that served as controls in the 2019 version (6.2% percentile rank increase on average). These findings demonstrate the utility of deep neural networks that are able to model disease liabilities from high-dimensional phenotypic data in large-scale population cohorts. Our pipeline of genome-wide association studies with disease liabilities can be applied to other biobanks with rich phenotype and genotype data.

Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, and histone acetylation may account for some of the unexplained variances. Epigenetic mechanisms modulate gene expression and can be suitable drug targets and can impact the action of nonepigenetic drugs. Pharmacoepigenetics is the field that studies the relationship between epigenetic variability and drug response. Much of this research focuses on compounds targeting epigenetic mechanisms, called epigenetic drugs, which are used to treat cancers, immune disorders, and other diseases. Several studies also suggest an epigenetic role in classical drug response; however, we know little about this area. The amount of information correlating epigenetic biomarkers to molecular datasets has recently expanded due to technological advances, and novel computational approaches have emerged to better identify and predict epigenetic interactions. We propose that the relationship between epigenetics and classical drug response may be examined using data already available by (1) finding regions of epigenetic variance, (2) pinpointing key epigenetic biomarkers within these regions, and (3) mapping these biomarkers to a drug-response phenotype. This approach expands on existing knowledge to generate putative pharmacoepigenetic relationships, which can be tested experimentally. Epigenetic modifications are involved in disease and drug response. Therefore, understanding how epigenetic drivers impact the response to classical drugs is important for improving drug design and administration to better treat disease.

However, explicit representations of genetic interactions often fail to capture complex interdependencies among genes, limiting the analytic power of such methods.RESULTS: We propose an extension of gene set enrichment analysis to a latent embedding space reflecting PPI network topology, called gene set proximity analysis (GSPA). Compared with existing methods, GSPA provides improved ability to identify disease-associated pathways in disease-matched gene expression datasets, while improving reproducibility of enrichment statistics for similar gene sets. GSPA is statistically straightforward, reducing to a version of traditional gene set enrichment analysis through a single user-defined parameter. We apply our method to identify novel drug associations with SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. Finally, we validate our drug association predictions through retrospective clinical analysis of claims data from 8 million patients, supporting a role for gabapentin as a risk factor and metformin as a protective factor for severe COVID-19.AVAILABILITY: GSPA is available for download as a command-line Python package at https://github.com/henrycousins/gspa.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

CTD is potentially lethal but actionable if detected early, with confirmatory diagnosis involving sequencing of SLC22A5. Interpretation of missense variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) is a major challenge. In this study, we sought to characterize the largest set to date (n = 150) of OCTN2 variants identified in diverse ancestral populations, with the goals of furthering our understanding of the mechanisms leading to OCTN2 loss-of-function (LOF) and creating a protein-specific variant effect prediction model for OCTN2 function. Uptake assays with 14C-carnitine revealed that 105 variants (70%) significantly reduced transport of carnitine compared to wild-type OCTN2, and 37 variants (25%) severely reduced function to less than 20%. All ancestral populations harbored LOF variants; 62% of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged variants impaired OCTN2 localization to the plasma membrane of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, and subcellular localization significantly associated with function, revealing a major LOF mechanism of interest for CTD. With these data, we trained a model to classify variants as functional (>20% function) or LOF (<20% function). Our model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods as evaluated by multiple performance metrics, with mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.895 \u00b1 0.025. In summary, in this study we generated a rich dataset of OCTN2 variant function and localization, revealed important disease-causing mechanisms, and improved upon machine learning-based prediction of OCTN2 variant function to aid in variant interpretation in the diagnosis and treatment of CTD.

The combinations of DNA motifs acting within homeostasis and disease, however, are unclear. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, TF footprinting, and H3K27ac-dependent DNA looping data were generated and a random-forest-based model was applied to identify 7,531 cell-type-specific cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across 15 diploid human cell types. A co-enrichment framework within CRMs nominated 838 cell-type-specific, recurrent heterotypic DNA motif combinations (DMCs), which were functionally validated using massively parallel reporter assays. Cancer cells engaged DMCs linked to neoplasia-enabling processes operative in normal cells while also activating new DMCs only seen in the neoplastic state. This integrative approach identifies cell-type-specific cis-regulatory combinatorial DNA motifs in diverse normal and diseased human cells and represents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory sequence logic in gene regulation.

We first used PPI network analysis to classify drugs based on proteins downstream of their targets and next predicted drug combination effects where drugs shared network proteins but had distinct binding proteins (e.g., targets, enzymes, or transporters). By classifying drugs using their downstream proteins, we had an 80.7% sensitivity for predicting rare drug combination effects documented in gold-standard datasets. We further measured the effect of predicted drug combinations on adverse outcome phenotypes using novel observational studies in the electronic health record. We tested predictions for 60 network-drug classes on seven adverse outcomes and measured changes in clinical outcomes for predicted combinations. These results demonstrate a novel paradigm for anticipating drug synergistic effects using proteins downstream of drug targets.

Artificial intelligence-based methods are promising in their potential to discover new treatment options. The task of drug repurposing hypothesis generation is well-posed as a link prediction problem in a knowledge graph (KG) of interacting of drugs, proteins, genes and disease phenotypes. KGs derived from biomedical literature are semantically rich and up-to-date representations of scientific knowledge. Inference methods on scientific KGs can be confounded by unspecified contexts and contradictions. Extracting context enables incorporation of relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic detail, such as tissue specificity of interactions. Contradictions in biomedical KGs may arise when contexts are omitted or due to contradicting research claims. In this review, we describe challenges to creating literature-scale representations of pharmacological knowledge and survey current approaches toward incorporating context and resolving contradictions.

Here, we investigate the capability of a deep neural network model to automate design of sequences onto protein backbones, having learned directly from crystal structure data and without any human-specified priors. The model generalizes to native topologies not seen during training, producing experimentally stable designs. We evaluate the generalizability of our method to a de novo TIM-barrel scaffold.

Machine learning algorithms that are able to learn accurate representations of protein structures are therefore poised to play a key role in protein engineering and drug development. The accuracy of such models in deployment is directly influenced by training data quality. The use of different experimental methods for protein structure determination may introduce bias into the training data. In this work, we evaluate the magnitude of this effect across three distinct tasks: estimation of model accuracy, protein sequence design, and catalytic residue prediction. Most protein structures are derived from X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM); we trained each model on datasets consisting of either all three structure types or of only X-ray data. We Find that across these tasks, models consistently perform worse on test sets derived from NMR and cryo-EM than they do on test sets of structures derived from X-ray crystallography, but that the difference can be mitigated when NMR and cryo-EM structures are included in the training set. Importantly, we show that including all three types of structures in the training set does not degrade test performance on X-ray structures, and in some cases even increases it. Finally, we examine the relationship between model performance and the biophysical properties of each method, and recommend that the biochemistry of the task of interest should be considered when composing training sets.

Introducing a system in the USA that allows for efficient access to such health data and ensures auditability of data facts, while avoiding data silos, will require fundamental changes in current practices. Here, we recommend the implementation of standardized data collection and transmission systems, universal identifiers for individual patients and end users, a reference standard infrastructure to support calibration and integration of laboratory results from equivalent tests, and modernized working practices. Requiring comprehensive and binding standards, rather than incentivizing voluntary and often piecemeal efforts for data exchange, will allow us to achieve the analytical information environment that patients need.

However, biological applications of network methods often suffer from inadequate follow-up. In this perspective, we discuss obstacles for contemporary network approaches-particularly focusing on challenges representing biological concepts, applying machine learning methods, and interpreting and validating computational findings about biology-in an effort to catalyze actionable biological discovery. View details for DOI 10.1093/bib/bbab437 View details for PubMedID 34849568 Objectives: We sought to cluster biological phenotypes using semantic similarity and create an easy-to-install, stable, and reproducible tool.Materials and Methods: We generated Phenotype Clustering (PhenClust)-a novel application of semantic similarity for interpreting biological phenotype associations-using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) metathesaurus, demonstrated the tool's application, and developed Docker containers with stable installations of two UMLS versions.Results: PhenClust identified disease clusters for drug network-associated phenotypes and a meta-analysis of drug target candidates. The Dockerized containers eliminated the requirement that the user install the UMLS metathesaurus.Discussion: Clustering phenotypes summarized all phenotypes associated with a drug network and two drug candidates. Docker containers can support dissemination and reproducibility of tools that are otherwise limited due to insufficient software support.Conclusion: PhenClust can improve interpretation of high-throughput biological analyses where many phenotypes are associated with a query and the Dockerized PhenClust achieved our objective of decreasing installation complexity.

GWAS have discovered associations between genetic variants and both drug efficacy and adverse drug reactions. Despite these successes, the design of GWAS in pharmacogenomics faces unique challenges. In this review we analyze the last decade of GWAS in pharmacogenomics. We review trends in publications over time, including the drugs and drug classes studied and the clinical phenotypes used. Several data sharing consortia have contributed substantially to the PGx GWAS literature. We anticipate increased focus on biobanks and highlight phenotypes that would best enable future pharmacogenomics discoveries. View details for DOI 10.1002/cpt.2349 View details for PubMedID 34185318 BACKGROUND: Defining clinical phenotypes provides opportunities for new diagnostics and may provide insights into early intervention and disease prevention. There is increasing evidence that patient-derived health data may contain information that complements traditional methods of clinical phenotyping. The utility of these data for defining meaningful phenotypic groups is of great interest because social media and online resources make it possible to query large cohorts of patients with health conditions.METHODS: We evaluated the degree to which patient-reported categorical data is useful for discovering subclinical phenotypes and evaluated its utility for discovering new measures of disease severity, treatment response and genetic architecture. Specifically, we examined the responses of 1961 patients with inflammatory bowel disease to questionnaires in search of sub-phenotypes. We applied machine learning methods to identify novel subtypes of Crohn's disease and studied their associations with drug responses.RESULTS: Using the patients' self-reported information, we identified two subpopulations of Crohn's disease; these subpopulations differ in disease severity, associations with smoking, and genetic transmission patterns. We also identified distinct features of drug response for the two Crohn's disease subtypes. These subtypes show a trend towards differential genotype signatures.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patient-defined data can have unplanned utility for defining disease subtypes and may be useful for guiding treatment approaches.

The impact of recurrent pathogenic variants is often understood, however there is a long tail of rare genetic variants that are uncharacterized. The problem of uncharacterized rare variation is especially acute when it occurs in genes of known clinical importance with functionally consequential variants and associated mechanisms. Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in these genes are discovered at a rate that outpaces current ability to classify them with databases of previous cases, experimental evaluation, and computational predictors. Clinicians are thus left without guidance about the significance of variants that may have actionable consequences. Computational prediction of the impact of rare genetic variation is increasingly becoming an important capability. In this paper, we review the technical and ethical challenges of interpreting the function of rare variants in two settings: inborn errors of metabolism in newborns and pharmacogenomics. We propose a framework for a genomic learning healthcare system with an initial focus on early-onset treatable disease in newborns and actionable pharmacogenomics. We argue that (1) a genomic learning healthcare system must allow for continuous collection and assessment of rare variants, (2) emerging machine learning methods will enable algorithms to predict the clinical impact of rare variants on protein function, and (3) ethical considerations must inform the construction and deployment of all rare-variation triage strategies, particularly with respect to health disparities arising from unbalanced ancestry representation.

While this higher prevalence is partially due to gender-related effects, biological sex differences likely also impact drug response. Publicly available gene expression databases provide a unique opportunity for examining drug response at a cellular level. However, missingness and heterogeneity of metadata prevent large-scale identification of drug exposure studies and limit assessments of sex bias. To address this, we trained organism-specific models to infer sample sex from gene expression data, and used entity normalization to map metadata cell line and drug mentions to existing ontologies. Using this method, we inferred sex labels for 450,371 human and 245,107 mouse microarray and RNA-seq samples from refine.bio.RESULTS: Overall, we find slight female bias (52.1%) in human samples and (62.5%) male bias in mouse samples; this corresponds to a majority of mixed sex studies in humans and single sex studies in mice, split between female-only and male-only (25.8% vs. 18.9% in human and 21.6% vs. 31.1% in mouse, respectively). In drug studies, we find limited evidence for sex-sampling bias overall; however, specific categories of drugs, including human cancer and mouse nervous system drugs, are enriched in female-only and male-only studies, respectively. We leverage our expression-based sex labels to further examine the complexity of cell line sex and assess the frequency of metadata sex label misannotations (2-5%).CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate limited overall sex bias, while highlighting high bias in specific subfields and underscoring the importance of including sex labels to better understand the underlying biology. We make our inferred and normalized labels, along with flags for misannotated samples, publicly available to catalyze the routine use of sex as a study variable in future analyses.

Two leading approaches for identifying these relationships in medical literature are: human expert led manual curation efforts, and modern data mining based automated approaches. The former generates small amounts of high-quality data, and the later offers large volumes of mixed quality data. The algorithmically extracted relationships are often accompanied by supporting evidence, such as, confidence scores, source articles, and surrounding contexts (excerpts) from the articles, that can used as data quality indicators. Tools that can leverage these quality indicators to help the user gain access to larger and high-quality data are needed.APPROACH: We introduce GeneDive, a web application for pharmacogenomics researchers and precision medicine practitioners that makes gene, disease, and drug interactions data easily accessible and usable. GeneDive is designed to meet three key objectives: (1) provide functionality to manage information-overload problem and facilitate easy assimilation of supporting evidence, (2) support longitudinal and exploratory research investigations, and (3) offer integration of user-provided interactions data without requiring data sharing.RESULTS: GeneDive offers multiple search modalities, visualizations, and other features that guide the user efficiently to the information of their interest. To facilitate exploratory research, GeneDive makes the supporting evidence and context for each interaction readily available and allows the data quality threshold to be controlled by the user as per their risk tolerance level. The interactive search-visualization loop enables relationship discoveries between diseases, genes, and drugs that might not be explicitly described in literature but are emergent from the source medical corpus and deductive reasoning. The ability to utilize user's data either in combination with the GeneDive native datasets or in isolation promotes richer data-driven exploration and discovery. These functionalities along with GeneDive's applicability for precision medicine, bringing the knowledge contained in biomedical literature to bear on particular clinical situations and improving patient care, are illustrated through detailed use cases.CONCLUSION: GeneDive is a comprehensive, broad-use biological interactions browser. The GeneDive application and information about its underlying system architecture are available at http://www.genedive.net. GeneDive Docker image is also available for download at this URL, allowing users to (1) import their own interaction data securely and privately; and (2) generate and test hypotheses across their own and other datasets.

For example, despite multiple available immunomodulators and immunosuppressants, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains difficult to treat. Heterogeneity in the disease across patients makes it challenging to select the optimal treatment regimens, and some patients do not respond to any of the existing treatment choices. Drug repurposing strategies for IBD have had limited clinical success and have not typically offered individualized patient-level treatment recommendations. In this work, we present NetPTP, a Network-based Personalized Treatment Prediction framework which models measured drug effects from gene expression data and applies them to patient samples to generate personalized ranked treatment lists. To accomplish this, we combine publicly available network, drug target, and drug effect data to generate treatment rankings using patient data. These ranked lists can then be used to prioritize existing treatments and discover new therapies for individual patients. We demonstrate how NetPTP captures and models drug effects, and we apply our framework to individual IBD samples to provide novel insights into IBD treatment.

The discovery of serious ADRs leading to substantial morbidity and mortality has resulted in mandatory Phase IV clinical trials, black box warnings, and withdrawal of drugs from the market. Real World Data, data collected during routine clinical care, is being adopted by innovators, regulators, payors, and providers to inform decision making throughout the product life cycle. We outline several different approaches to modern pharmacovigilance, including spontaneous reporting databases, electronic health record monitoring and research frameworks, social media surveillance, and the use of digital devices. Some of these platforms are well established while others are still emerging, or experimental. We highlight both the potential opportunity, as well as the existing challenges within these pharmacovigilance systems that have already begun to impact the drug development process, as well as the landscape of postmarket drug safety monitoring. Further research and investment into different and complementary pharmacovigilance systems is needed to ensure the continued safety of pharmacotherapy.

The global quarantine shut-downs complicated scientific matters because many laboratories were closed down unless they were actively doing COVID-19 related research, making repurposing of activities difficult for many biomedical researchers. Biomedical informaticians, who have been primarily able to continue their research through remote work and video conferencing, have been able to maintain normal activities. In addition to continuing ongoing studies, there has been great grass roots interest in helping in the fight against COVID-19. In this commentary, we describe several projects that arose from this desire to help, and the lessons that the authors learned along the way. We then offer some insights into how these lessons might be applied to make scientific progress be more efficient in future crisis scenarios.

Clinically actionable associations inform guidelines created by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), but the broad impact of genetic variation on entire populations is not well-understood. We analyzed PGx allele and phenotype frequencies for 487,409 participants in the U.K. Biobank, the largest PGx study to date. For fourteen CPIC pharmacogenes known to influence human drug response, we find that 99.5% of individuals may have an atypical response to at least one drug; on average they may have an atypical response to 10.3 drugs. Nearly 24% of participants have been prescribed a drug for which they are predicted to have an atypical response. Non-European populations carry a greater frequency of variants that are predicted to be functionally deleterious; many of these are not captured by current PGx allele definitions. Strategies for detecting and interpreting rare variation will be critical for enabling broad application of pharmacogenetics.

Genetic variations in CYP2D6 are responsible for interindividual heterogeneity in drug response that can lead to drug toxicity and ineffective treatment, making CYP2D6 one of the most important pharmacogenes. Prediction of CYP2D6 phenotype relies on curation of literature-derived functional studies to assign a functional status to CYP2D6 haplotypes. As the number of large-scale sequencing efforts grows, new haplotypes continue to be discovered, and assignment of function is challenging to maintain. To address this challenge, we have trained a convolutional neural network to predict functional status of CYP2D6 haplotypes, called Hubble.2D6. Hubble.2D6 predicts haplotype function from sequence data and was trained using two pre-training steps with a combination of real and simulated data. We find that Hubble.2D6 predicts CYP2D6 haplotype functional status with 88% accuracy in a held-out test set and explains 47.5% of the variance in in vitro functional data among star alleles with unknown function. Hubble.2D6 may be a useful tool for assigning function to haplotypes with uncurated function, and used for screening individuals who are at risk of being poor metabolizers.

Cases were randomly allocated to the recommender system in a 3:2 ratio. A panel of clinicians scored whether the orders placed were clinically appropriate. Our primary outcome included the difference in clinical appropriateness scores. Secondary outcomes included total number of orders, case time, and survey responses.RESULTS: Clinical appropriateness scores per order were comparable for cases randomized to the order recommender system (mean difference -0.11 order per score, 95% CI: [-0.41, 0.20]). Physicians using the recommender placed more orders (median 16 vs 15 orders, incidence rate ratio 1.09, 95%CI: [1.01-1.17]). Case times were comparable with the recommender system. Order suggestions generated from the recommender system were more likely to match physician needs than standard manual search options. Physicians used recommender suggestions in 98% of available cases. Approximately 95% of participants agreed the system would be useful for their workflows.DISCUSSION: User testing with a simulated electronic medical record interface can assess the value of machine learning and clinical decision support tools for clinician usability and acceptance before live deployments.CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can use and accept machine learned clinical order recommendations integrated into an electronic order entry interface in a simulated setting. The clinical appropriateness of orders entered was comparable even when supported by automated recommendations.

Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as new cell types. MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are as yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large mouse cell atlas and show its ability to accurately identify cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, MARS automatically generates interpretable names for new cell types by probabilistically defining a cell type in the embedding space.

Over the last two decades, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) has built a unique repository of pharmacogenomic knowledge, including annotations of clinical guideline and regulator-approved drug labels in addition to evidence-based drug pathways and annotations of the scientific literature. All of this knowledge is freely accessible on the PharmGKB website. In the first of a series of PharmGKB tutorials, we introduce the PharmGKB COVID-19 portal and, using examples of drugs found in the portal, demonstrate some of the main features of PharmGKB.

View details for DOI 10.1002/cpt.2067 View details for PubMedID 32978778 Sex differences have been shown in laboratory biomarkers; however, the extent to which this is due to genetics is unknown. In this study, we infer sex-specific genetic parameters (heritability and genetic correlation) across 33 quantitative biomarker traits in 181,064 females and 156,135 males from the UK Biobank study. We apply a Bayesian Mixture Model, Sex Effects Mixture Model(SEMM), to Genome-wide Association Study summary statistics in order to (1) estimate the contributions of sex to the genetic variance of these biomarkers and (2) identify variants whose statistical association with these traits is sex-specific. We find that the genetics of most biomarker traits are shared between males and females, with the notable exception of testosterone, where we identify 119 female and 445 male-specific variants. These include protein-altering variants in steroid hormone production genes (POR, UGT2B7). Using the sex-specific variants as genetic instruments for Mendelian randomization, we find evidence for causal links between testosterone levels and height, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and type 2 diabetes. We also show that sex-specific polygenic risk score models for testosterone outperform a combined model. Overall, these results demonstrate that while sex has a limited role in the genetics of most biomarker traits, sex plays an important role in testosterone genetics.

Leveraging gene sets to gain insight into biological discovery requires computational methods for converting them into a useful form for available machine learning models. Here, we study the problem of embedding gene sets as compact features that are compatible with available machine learning codes. We present Set2Gaussian, a novel network-based gene set embedding approach, which represents each gene set as a multivariate Gaussian distribution rather than a single point in the low-dimensional space, according to the proximity of these genes in a protein-protein interaction network. We demonstrate that Set2Gaussian improves gene set member identification, accurately stratifies tumors, and finds concise gene sets for gene set enrichment analysis. We further show how Set2Gaussian allows us to identify a previously unknown clinical prognostic and predictive subnetwork around NEFM in sarcoma, which we validate in independent cohorts.

We have focused on identifying repurposing candidates for the transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2), which is critical for entry of coronaviruses into cells. Using known 3D structures of close homologs, we created seven homology models. We also identified a set of serine protease inhibitor drugs, generated several conformations of each, and docked them into our models. We used three known chemical (non-drug) inhibitors and one validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 in MERS as benchmark compounds and found six compounds with predicted high binding affinity in the range of the known inhibitors. We also showed that a previously published weak inhibitor, Camostat, had a significantly lower binding score than our six compounds. All six compounds are anticoagulants with significant and potentially dangerous clinical effects and side effects. Nonetheless, if these compounds significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, they could represent a potentially useful clinical tool.

Extensive evidence implicates genetic factors and signaling disruption in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Changes in transcription often underlie this molecular pathway dysregulation; individual patient transcriptional data can improve the efficacy of diagnosis and treatment. Recent large-scale genomic studies have uncovered shared genetic modules across multiple psychiatric disorders - providing an opportunity for an integrated multi-disease approach for diagnosis. Moreover, network-based models informed by gene expression can represent pathological biological mechanisms and suggest new genes for diagnosis and treatment. Here, we use patient gene expression data from multiple studies to classify psychiatric diseases, integrate knowledge from expert-curated databases and publicly available experimental data to create augmented disease-specific gene sets, and use these to recommend disease-relevant drugs. From Gene Expression Omnibus, we extract expression data from 145 cases of schizophrenia, 82 cases of bipolar disorder, 190 cases of major depressive disorder, and 307 shared controls. We use pathway-based approaches to predict psychiatric disease diagnosis with a random forest model (78% accuracy) and derive important features to augment available drug and disease signatures. Using protein-protein-interaction networks and embedding-based methods, we build a pipeline to prioritize treatments for psychiatric diseases that achieves a 3.4-fold improvement over a background model. Thus, we demonstrate that gene-expression-derived pathway features can diagnose psychiatric diseases and that molecular insights derived from this classification task can inform treatment prioritization for psychiatric diseases.

There is an incredible amount of diversity in Asian and admixed populations that has not been studied in a pharmacogenetic context. The known pharmacogenetic differences in Asians subgroups generally represent previously known variants that are present at much lower or higher frequencies in Asians compared to other populations. This review aims to summarize the main drugs and known genes that appear to have differences in their pharmacogenetic properties in certain Asian populations. Evidence based guidelines and summary statistics from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) were analyzed for ethnic differences in outcomes. Implicated drugs included commonly prescribed drugs such as warfarin, clopidogrel, carbamazepine, and allopurinol. The majority of these associations are due to Asians more commonly being CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and carriers of the HLA-B*15:02 allele. The relative risk increase seen ranged between genes and drugs but could be over 100x more likely in Asians such as the 172x increase in risk of SJS and TEN with carbamazepine use amongst HLA-B*15:02 carriers. The effects ranged from relatively benign reactions such as reduced drug efficacy to severe cutaneous skin reactions. These reactions are severe and prevalent enough to warrant pharmacogenetic testing and appropriate changes in dosing and medication choice for at risk populations. Further studies should be done on Asian cohorts to more fully understand pharmacogenetic variants in these populations to understand how such differences may influence drug response.

However, the morphological patterns associated with the molecular subtypes have not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we developed a quantitative histopathology analytic framework to identify the types and gene expression subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer objectively.We processed whole-slide histopathology images of lung adenocarcinoma (n = 427) and lung squamous cell carcinoma patients (n = 457) in the Cancer Genome Atlas. We built convolutional neural networks to classify histopathology images, evaluated their performance by the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs), and validated the results in an independent cohort (n = 125).To establish neural networks for quantitative image analyses, we first built convolutional neural network models to identify tumor regions from adjacent dense benign tissues (AUCs > 0.935) and recapitulated expert pathologists' diagnosis (AUCs > 0.877), with the results validated in an independent cohort (AUCs = 0.726-0.864). We further demonstrated that quantitative histopathology morphology features identified the major transcriptomic subtypes of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (P < .01).Our study is the first to classify the transcriptomic subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer using fully automated machine learning methods. Our approach does not rely on prior pathology knowledge and can discover novel clinically relevant histopathology patterns objectively. The developed procedure is generalizable to other tumor types or diseases.

Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity \"type 1 diabetes\" in the phrase \"type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\" This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE's existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems.

Curated databases of chemical reactions exist but these databases struggle to keep up with the exponential growth of the biomedical literature. Conventional text mining pipelines provide tools to automatically extract entities and relationships from the scientific literature, and partially replace expert curation, but such machine learning frameworks often require a large amount of labeled training data and thus lack scalability for both larger document corpora and new relationship types.We developed an application of Snorkel, a weakly supervised learning framework, for extracting chemical reaction relationships from biomedical literature abstracts. For this work, we defined a chemical reaction relationship as the transformation of chemical A to chemical B. We built and evaluated our system on small annotated sets of chemical reaction relationships from two corpora: curated bacteria-related abstracts from the MetaCyc database (MetaCyc_Corpus) and a more general set of abstracts annotated with MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) term Bacteria (Bacteria_Corpus; a superset of MetaCyc_Corpus). For the MetaCyc_Corpus, we obtained 84% precision and 41% recall (55% F1 score). Extending to the more general Bacteria_Corpus decreased precision to 62% with only a four-point drop in recall to 37% (46% F1 score). Overall, the Bacteria_Corpus contained two orders of magnitude more candidate chemical reaction relationships (nine million candidates vs 68,0000 candidates) and had a larger class imbalance (2.5% positives vs 5% positives) as compared to the MetaCyc_Corpus. In total, we extracted 6871 chemical reaction relationships from nine million candidates in the Bacteria_Corpus.With this work, we built a database of chemical reaction relationships from almost 900,000 scientific abstracts without a large training set of labeled annotations. Further, we showed the generalizability of our initial application built on MetaCyc documents enriched with chemical reactions to a general set of articles related to bacteria.

CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles play an important role in this response, but account for only a small proportion of variability in response to clopidogrel. An aim of the International Clopidogrel Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ICPC) is to identify other genetic determinants of clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical response. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using DNA from 2,750 European ancestry individuals, using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) induced platelet reactivity and major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events as outcome parameters. GWAS for platelet reactivity revealed a strong signal for CYP2C19*2 (p-value=1.67e-33). After correction for CYP2C19*2 no other SNP reached genome-wide significance. GWAS for a combined clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (5.0% event rate) or a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (4.7% event rate) showed no significant results, although in coronary artery disease, percutaneous coronary intervention, and acute coronary syndrome subgroups, mutations in SCOS5P1, CDC42BPA and CTRAC1 showed genome-wide significance (lowest p-values: 1.07e-09, 4.53e-08 and 2.60e-10, respectively). CYP2C19*2 is the strongest genetic determinant of on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity. We identified three novel associations in clinical outcome subgroups, suggestive for each of these outcomes.

However, the small market size of individual rare diseases, combined with the time and capital requirements of pharmaceutical R&D, have hindered the development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be used to treat diseases different from their original indications. In order to generate drug repurposing hypotheses in a systematic and comprehensive fashion, it is essential to integrate information from across the literature of pharmacology, genetics, and pathology. To this end, we leverage a newly developed knowledge graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR). GNBR is a large, heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising drug, disease, and gene (or protein) entities linked by a small set of semantic themes derived from the abstracts of biomedical literature. We apply a knowledge graph embedding method that explicitly models the uncertainty associated with literature-derived relationships and uses link prediction to generate drug repurposing hypotheses. This approach achieves high performance on a gold-standard test set of known drug indications (AUROC = 0.89) and is capable of generating novel repurposing hypotheses, which we independently validate using external literature sources and protein interaction networks. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our model to produce explanations of its predictions.

The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) provides highly curated information on the effect of genetic variation on drug response and side effects for a wide range of drugs. PharmGKB's scientific curators triage, review and annotate a large number of papers each year but the task is challenging. We present the PGxMine resource, a text-mined resource of pharmacogenomic associations from all accessible published literature to assist in the curation of PharmGKB. We developed a supervised machine learning pipeline to extract associations between a variant (DNA and protein changes, star alleles and dbSNP identifiers) and a chemical. PGxMine covers 452 chemicals and 2,426 variants and contains 19,930 mentions of pharmacogenomic associations across 7,170 papers. An evaluation by PharmGKB curators found that 57 of the top 100 associations not found in PharmGKB led to 83 curatable papers and a further 24 associations would likely lead to curatable papers through citations.

CRISPRi genetic interaction analysis revealed Retro-2 activity resembles disruption of the transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) pathway, which mediates post-translational ER-targeting and insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins, including SNAREs required for retrograde transport. Cell-based and in vitro assays show that Retro-2 blocks delivery of newly-synthesized TA-proteins to the ER-targeting factor ASNA1 (TRC40). An ASNA1 point mutant identified using CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis abolishes both the cytoprotective effect of Retro-2 against ricin and its inhibitory effect on ASNA1-mediated ER-targeting. Together, our work explains how Retro-2 prevents retrograde trafficking of toxins by inhibiting TA-protein targeting, describes a general CRISPR strategy for predicting the MOA of small molecules, and paves the way for drugging the TRC pathway to treat broad classes of viruses known to be inhibited by Retro-2.

Using continuous remote monitoring data from cardiac implantable electronic devices, we sought to evaluate if machine learned signatures of AF burden could provide prognostic information on near-term risk of stroke when compared to conventional risk scores.METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively identified Veterans Health Administration serviced patients with cardiac implantable electronic device remote monitoring data and at least one day of device-registered AF. The first 30 days of remote monitoring in nonstroke controls were compared against the past 30 days of remote monitoring before stroke in cases. We trained 3 types of models on our data: (1) convolutional neural networks, (2) random forest, and (3) L1 regularized logistic regression (LASSO). We calculated the CHA2DS2-VASc score for each patient and compared its performance against machine learned indices based on AF burden in separate test cohorts. Finally, we investigated the effect of combining our AF burden models with CHA2DS2-VASc. We identified 3114 nonstroke controls and 71 stroke cases, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Random forest performed the best in the test data set (area under the curve [AUC]=0.662) and convolutional neural network in the validation dataset (AUC=0.702), whereas CHA2DS2-VASc had an AUC of 0.5 or less in both data sets. Combining CHA2DS2-VASc with random forest and convolutional neural network yielded a validation AUC of 0.696 and test AUC of 0.634, yielding the highest average AUC on nontraining data.CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study found that machine learning and ensemble methods that incorporate daily AF burden signature provided incremental prognostic value for risk stratification beyond CHA2DS2-VASc for near-term risk of stroke.

While investigations have identified genetic determinants of inter-individual variability in on-treatment platelet inhibition (e.g. CYP2C19*2), evidence that these variants have clinical utility to predict major adverse cardiovascular events remains controversial.METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the impact of 31 candidate gene polymorphisms on ADP-stimulated platelet reactivity in 3,391 clopidogrel-treated coronary artery disease patients of the International Clopidogrel Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ICPC). The influence of these polymorphisms on cardiovascular events (CVE) was tested in 2,134 ICPC patients (N=129 events) in whom clinical event data were available. Several variants were associated with on-treatment ADP-stimulated platelet reactivity (CYP2C19*2, P=8.8x10-54; CES1 G143E, P=1.3x10-16; CYP2C19*17, P=9.5x10-10; CYP2B6 1294+53C>T, P=3.0x10-4; CYP2B6 516G>T, P=1.0x10-3; CYP2C9*2, P=1.2x10-3; and CYP2C9*3, P=1.5x10-3). While no individual variant was associated with CVEs, generation of a pharmacogenomic polygenic response score (PgxRS) revealed that patients who carried a greater number of alleles that associated with increased on-treatment platelet reactivity were more likely to experience CVEs (beta=0.17, SE 0.06, P=0.01) and cardiovascular-related death (beta=0.43, SE 0.16, P=0.007). Patients who carried 8 or more risk alleles were significantly more likely to experience CVEs (OR=1.78, 95%CI 1.14-2.76, P=0.01) and cardiovascular death (OR=4.39, 95%CI 1.35-14.27, P=0.01) compared to patients who carried 6 or fewer of these alleles.CONCLUSION: Several polymorphisms impact clopidogrel response and PgxRS is a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes. Additional investigations that identify novel determinants of clopidogrel response and validating polygenic models may facilitate future precision medicine strategies.

One challenge of implementing PGx is extracting genomic variants and assigning haplotypes in order to apply prescribing recommendations and information from CPIC, FDA, PharmGKB, etc. PharmCAT (1) extracts variants specified in guidelines from a genetic dataset derived from sequencing or genotyping technologies; (2) infers haplotypes and diplotypes; and (3) generates a report containing genotype/diplotype-based annotations and guideline recommendations. We describe PharmCAT and a pilot validation project comparing results for 1000 Genomes sequences of Coriell samples with corresponding Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program (GeT-RM) sample characterization. PharmCAT was highly concordant with the GeT-RM data. PharmCAT is available in GitHub to evaluate, test and report results back to the community. As precision medicine becomes more prevalent, our ability to consistently, accurately, and clearly define and report PGx annotations and prescribing recommendations is critical.

As part of the fifth iteration of the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation, participants were asked to predict VTE status in exome data from African American subjects. Participants were provided with 103 unlabeled exomes from patients treated with warfarin for non-VTE causes or VTE and asked to predict which disease each subject had been treated for. Given the lack of training data, many participants opted to use unsupervised machine learning methods, clustering the exomes by variation in genes known to be associated with VTE. The best performing method using only VTE related genes achieved an AUC of 0.65. Here we discuss the range of methods used in the prediction of VTE from sequence data and explore some of the difficulties of conducting a challenge with known confounders. Additionally, we show that an existing genetic risk score for VTE that was developed in European subjects works well in African Americans. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The massive amount of genetic data generated from large cohorts of patients with variable drug phenotypes have led to advances in this field. Understanding the application of pharmacogenomics in dermatology could inform clinical practice and provide insight for future research. The Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium are among the resources to help clinicians and researchers navigate the many gene-drug associations that have already been discovered. The implementation of clinical pharmacogenomics within health care systems remains an area of ongoing development.

However, treatment response during an initial therapeutic trial is often poor and is difficult to predict. Heterogeneity of response to SSRIs in depressed patients is partly driven by co-occurring somatic disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and obesity. CAD and obesity may also be associated with metabolic side effects of SSRIs. In this study, we assessed the association of CAD and obesity with treatment response to SSRIs in patients with MDD using a polygenic score (PGS) approach. Additionally, we performed cross-trait meta-analyses to pinpoint genetic variants underpinnings the relationship of CAD and obesity with SSRIs treatment response. First, PGSs were calculated at different p value thresholds (PT) for obesity and CAD. Next, binary logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association of the PGSs to SSRIs treatment response in a discovery sample (ISPC, N=865), and in a replication cohort (STAR*D, N=1,878). Finally, a cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis was performed by combining summary statistics. We show that the PGSs for CAD and obesity were inversely associated with SSRIs treatment response. At the most significant thresholds, the PGS for CAD and body mass index accounted 1.3%, and 0.8% of the observed variability in treatment response to SSRIs, respectively. In the cross-trait meta-analyses, we identified (1) 14 genetic loci (including NEGR1, CADM2, PMAIP1, PARK2) that are associated with both obesity and SSRIs treatment response; (2) five genetic loci (LINC01412, PHACTR1, CDKN2B, ATXN2, KCNE2) with effects on CAD and SSRIs treatment response. Our findings implicate that the genetic variants of CAD and obesity are linked to SSRIs treatment response in MDD. A better SSRIs treatment response might be achieved through a stratified allocation of treatment for MDD patients with a genetic risk for obesity or CAD.

However, the task of predicting these interactions given a protein structure is difficult. Here we show that, by leveraging a deep learning model NucleicNet, attributes such as binding preference of RNA backbone constituents and different bases can be predicted from local physicochemical characteristics of protein structure surface. On a diverse set of challenging RNA-binding proteins, including Fem-3-binding-factor 2, Argonaute 2 and Ribonuclease III, NucleicNet can accurately recover interaction modes discovered by structural biology experiments. Furthermore, we show that, without seeing any in vitro or in vivo assay data, NucleicNet can still achieve consistency with experiments, including RNAcompete, Immunoprecipitation Assay, and siRNA Knockdown Benchmark. NucleicNet can thus serve to provide quantitative fitness of RNA sequences for given binding pockets or to predict potential binding pockets and binding RNAs for previously unknown RNA binding proteins.

RWE has generated important medical discoveries, especially in areas where traditional clinical trials would be unethical or infeasible. However, RWE suffers from several issues that hinder its ability to provide proof of treatment efficacy at a level comparable to randomized controlled trials. In this review article, we summarized the advantages and limitations of RWE, identified the key opportunities for RWE, and pointed the way forward to maximize the potential of RWE for regulatory purposes.

The power of social media as well as other electronic devices can improve adherence as evidenced by the development of the app bant. Additionally, systemic analysis of social media content by Screenome can identify health events not always captured by regular health care. By better identifying these health care events we can improve our current health care system as we will be able to better tailor to the patients' needs.

Current computational methods trained on in vitro binding data are limited by insufficient training data and algorithmic constraints. Here we describe MARIA (major histocompatibility complex analysis with recurrent integrated architecture; https://maria.stanford.edu/ ), a multimodal recurrent neural network for predicting the likelihood of antigen presentation from a gene of interest in the context of specific HLA class II alleles. In addition to in vitro binding measurements, MARIA is trained on peptide HLA ligand sequences identified by mass spectrometry, expression levels of antigen genes and protease cleavage signatures. Because it leverages these diverse training data and our improved machine learning framework, MARIA (area under the curve = 0.89-0.92) outperformed existing methods in validation datasets. Across independent cancer neoantigen studies, peptides with high MARIA scores are more likely to elicit strong CD4+ T cell responses. MARIA allows identification of immunogenic epitopes in diverse cancers and autoimmune disease.

The aim of the present study was to undertake a meta-analysis at individual patients' level to capture the possible effect of ethnicity, gene-gene interaction or other drugs on the association and to verify if inclusion of CYP4F2*3 variant into dosing algorithms improves the prediction of mean coumarin dose. We asked the authors of our previous meta-analysis (30 articles) and of 38 new articles retrieved by a systematic review to send us individual patients' data. The final collection consists 15,754 patients split into a derivation and validation cohort. The CYP4F2*3 polymorphism was consistently associated with an increase in mean coumarin dose (+9% (95%CI 7-10%), with a higher effect in females, in patients taking acenocoumarol and in Whites. The inclusion of the CYP4F2*3 in dosing algorithms slightly improved the prediction of stable coumarin dose. New pharmacogenetic equations potentially useful for clinical practice were derived.

An incomplete understanding of how drugs exert their effects hinders regulatory and pharmaceutical industry projections of a drug's benefits and risks. Signaling pathways mediate drug response and while many signaling molecules have been characterized for their contribution to disease or their role in drug side effects, our knowledge of these pathways is incomplete. To better understand all signaling molecules involved in drug response and the phenotype associations of these molecules, we created a novel method, PathFX, a non-commercial entity, to identify these pathways and drug-related phenotypes. We benchmarked PathFX by identifying drugs' marketed disease indications and reported a sensitivity of 41%, a 2.7-fold improvement over similar approaches. We then used PathFX to strengthen signals for drug-adverse event pairs occurring in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and also identified opportunities for drug repurposing for new diseases based on interaction paths that associated a marketed drug to that disease. By discovering molecular interaction pathways, PathFX improved our understanding of drug associations to safety and efficacy phenotypes. The algorithm may provide a new means to improve regulatory and therapeutic development decisions.

Current population grouping methods to communicate these patterns are insufficient as they are inconsistent and fail to reflect the global distribution of genetic variability. To facilitate and standardize the reporting of variability in pharmacogenetic allele frequencies, we present seven geographically-defined groups: American, Central/South Asian, East Asian, European, Near Eastern, Oceanian, and Sub-Saharan African, and two admixed groups: African American/Afro-Caribbean and Latino. These nine groups are defined by global autosomal genetic structure and based on data from large-scale sequencing initiatives. We recognize that broadly grouping global populations is an oversimplification of human diversity and does not capture complex social and cultural identity. However, these groups meet a key need in pharmacogenetics research by enabling consistent communication of the scale of variability in global allele frequencies and are now used by PharmGKB.

However, transcriptomic analysis is challenging because the data is inherently noisy and high-dimensional. Gene set analysis is currently widely used to alleviate the issue of high dimensionality, but the user-defined choice of gene sets can introduce biasness in results. In this paper, we advocate the use of a fixed set of transcriptomic modules for such analysis. We apply independent component analysis to the large collection of microarray data in GEO in order to discover reproducible transcriptomic modules that can be used as features for machine learning. We evaluate the usability of these modules across six studies, and demonstrate (1) their usage as features for sample classification, and also their robustness in dealing with small training sets, (2) their regularization of data when clustering samples and (3) the biological relevancy of differentially expressed features.RESULTS: We identified 139 reproducible transcriptomic modules, which we term fundamental components (FCs). In studies with less than 50 samples, FC-space classification model outperformed their gene-space counterparts, with higher sensitivity (p<0.01). The models also had higher accuracy and negative predictive value (p<0.01) for small data sets (less than 30 samples). Additionally, we observed a reduction in batch effects when data is clustered in the FC-space. Finally, we found that differentially expressed FCs mapped to GO terms that were also identified via traditional gene-based approaches.CONCLUSIONS: The 139 FCs provide biologically-relevant summarization of transcriptomic data, and their performance in low sample settings suggest that they should be employed in such studies in order to harness the data efficiently.

Traditional approaches for kinase selectivity analysis using biochemical activity and binding assays are useful but can be costly and are often limited by the kinases that are available. On the other hand, current computational kinase selectivity prediction methods are computational intensive and can rarely achieve sufficient accuracy for large-scale kinome wide inhibitor selectivity profiling.Results: Here, we present a KinomeFEATURE database for kinase binding site similarity search by comparing protein microenvironments characterized using diverse physiochemical descriptors. Initial selectivity prediction of 15 known kinase inhibitors achieved an>90% accuracy and demonstrated improved performance in comparison to commonly used kinase inhibitor selectivity prediction methods. Additional kinase ATP binding site similarity assessment (120 binding sites) identified 55 kinases with significant promiscuity and revealed unexpected inhibitor cross-activities between PKR and FGFR2 kinases. Kinome-wide selectivity profiling of 11 kinase drug candidates predicted novel as well as experimentally validated off-targets and suggested structural mechanisms of kinase cross-activities. Our study demonstrated potential utilities of our approach for large-scale kinase inhibitor selectivity profiling that could contribute to kinase drug development and safety assessment.Availability: The KinomeFEATURE database are available at https://simtk.org/projects/kdb.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Platelet inhibition by clopidogrel shows wide interpatient variability, and high on-treatment platelet reactivity is a risk factor for atherothrombotic events, particularly in high-risk populations. CYP2C19 polymorphism plays an important role in this variability, but heritability estimates suggest that additional genetic variants remain unidentified. The aim of the International Clopidogrel Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ICPC) is to identify genetic determinants of clopidogrel pharmacodynamics and clinical response.Based on the data published on www.clinicaltrials.gov, clopidogrel intervention studies containing genetic and platelet function data were identified for participation. Lead investigators were invited to share DNA samples, platelet function test results, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular outcomes to perform candidate gene and genome-wide studies.In total, 17 study sites from 13 countries participate in the ICPC, contributing individual patient data from 8,829 patients. Available adenosine diphosphate-stimulated platelet function tests included vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assay, light transmittance aggregometry, and the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. A proof-of-principle analysis based on genotype data provided by each group showed a strong and consistent association between CYP2C19*2 and platelet reactivity (P value=5.1 \u00d7 10-40).The ICPC aims to identify new loci influencing clopidogrel efficacy by using state-of-the-art genetic approaches in a large cohort of clopidogrel-treated patients to better understand the genetic basis of on-treatment response variability. View details for PubMedID 29653637 Gene-based supervised machine learning classification models have been widely used to differentiate disease states, predict disease progression and determine effective treatment options. However, many of these classifiers are sensitive to noise and frequently do not replicate in external validation sets. For complex, heterogeneous diseases, these classifiers are further limited by being unable to capture varying combinations of genes that lead to the same phenotype. Pathway-based classification can overcome these challenges by using robust, aggregate features to represent biological mechanisms. In this work, we developed a novel pathway-based approach, PRObabilistic Pathway Score, which uses genes to calculate individualized pathway scores for classification. Unlike previous individualized pathway-based classification methods that use gene sets, we incorporate gene interactions using probabilistic graphical models to more accurately represent the underlying biology and achieve better performance. We apply our method to differentiate two similar complex diseases, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which are the two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using five IBD datasets, we compare our method against four gene-based and four alternative pathway-based classifiers in distinguishing CD from UC. We demonstrate superior classification performance and provide biological insight into the top pathways separating CD from UC.PROPS is available as a R package, which can be downloaded at http://simtk.org/home/props or on Bioconductor.rbaltman@stanford.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Moreover, personality traits are thought to be associated with response to antidepressants treatment that might partly be mediated by genetic factors. In this study, we examined whether polygenic scores (PGSs) derived from the Big Five personality traits predict treatment response and remission in patients with MDD who were prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition, we performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on these traits to identify genetic variants underpinning the cross-trait polygenic association. The PGS analysis was performed using data from two cohorts: the Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS, n = 529) and the International SSRI Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ISPC, n = 865). The cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses were conducted by combining GWAS summary statistics on SSRIs treatment outcome and on the personality traits. The results showed that the PGS for openness and neuroticism were associated with SSRIs treatment outcomes at p < 0.05 across PT thresholds in both cohorts. A significant association was also found between the PGS for conscientiousness and SSRIs treatment response in the PGRN-AMPS sample. In the cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses, we identified eight loci associated with (a) SSRIs response and conscientiousness near YEATS4 gene and (b) SSRI remission and neuroticism eight loci near PRAG1, MSRA, XKR6, ELAVL2, PLXNC1, PLEKHM1, and BRUNOL4 genes. An assessment of a polygenic load for personality traits may assist in conjunction with clinical data to predict whether MDD patients might respond favorably to SSRIs. View details for PubMedID 29559929 Our goal is to answer the question: compared with experimental structures, how useful are predicted models for functional annotation? We assessed the functional utility of predicted models by comparing the performances of a suite of methods for functional characterization on the predictions and the experimental structures. We identified 28 sites in 25 protein targets to perform functional assessment. These 28 sites included nine sites with known ligand binding (holo-sites), nine sites that are expected or suggested by experimental authors for small molecule binding (apo-sites), and Ten sites containing important motifs, loops, or key residues with important disease-associated mutations. We evaluated the utility of the predictions by comparing their microenvironments to the experimental structures. Overall structural quality correlates with functional utility. However, the best-ranked predictions (global) may not have the best functional quality (local). Our assessment provides an ability to discriminate between predictions with high structural quality. When assessing ligand-binding sites, most prediction methods have higher performance on apo-sites than holo-sites. Some servers show consistently high performance for certain types of functional sites. Finally, many functional sites are associated with protein-protein interaction. We also analyzed biologically relevant features from the protein assemblies of two targets where the active site spanned the protein-protein interface. For the assembly targets, we find that the features in the models are mainly determined by the choice of template.

Using the significant Mendelian diseases, we performed pathway enrichment analysis and constructed a model using gene expression datasets to differentiate Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and healthy patient samples.We found 50 Mendelian diseases were significantly associated with IBD, with 40 being significantly associated with both CD and UC. Our results for CD replicated those from previous studies. Pathways that were enriched consisted of mainly immune and metabolic processes with a focus on tolerance and oxidative stress. Our 3-way classifier for UC, CD, and healthy samples yielded an accuracy of 72%.Mendelian diseases that are significantly associated with IBD may reveal novel insights into the genetic architecture of IBD.

To create a more granular schema, a group of drug developers, researchers, patient advocates, and regulators developed a crowdsourced atlas of the steps involved in translating basic discoveries into health interventions, annotated with the steps that are particularly prone to difficulty or failure. This Drug Discovery, Development, and Deployment Map (4DM), provides a network view of the process, which will be useful for communication and education to those new to the field, orientation and navigation of individual projects, and prioritization of technology development and re-engineering endeavors to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

Determining the risk factors associated with reversals in LST goals can improve patient and provider appreciation for the natural history and epidemiology of critical care and inform decision making around the (continued) use of LSTs.This is a single institution retrospective cohort study of patients receiving life sustaining treatment in an academic tertiary hospital from 2009 to 2013. Deidentified patient electronic medical record data was collected via the clinical data warehouse to study the outcomes of treatment limiting Comfort Care and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. Extended multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the association of patient and clinical factors with subsequent treatment limiting orders.10,157 patients received life-sustaining treatment while initially Full Code (allowing all resuscitative measures). Of these, 770 (8.0%) transitioned to Comfort Care (with discontinuation of any life-sustaining treatments) while 1,669 (16%) patients received new DNR orders that reflect preferences to limit further life-sustaining treatment options. Patients who were older (Hazard Ratio(HR) 1.37 [95% CI 1.28-1.47] per decade), with cerebrovascular disease (HR 2.18 [95% CI 1.69-2.81]), treated by the Medical ICU (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.49-2.49]) and Hematology-Oncology (HR 1.87 [95% CI 1.27-2.74]) services, receiving vasoactive infusions (HR 1.76 [95% CI 1.28, 2.43]) or continuous renal replacement (HR 1.83 [95% CI 1.34, 2.48]) were more likely to transition to Comfort Care. Any new DNR orders were more likely for patients who were older (HR 1.43 [95% CI 1.38-1.48] per decade), female (HR 1.30 [95% CI 1.17-1.44]), with cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.45 [95% CI 1.25-1.67]) or metastatic solid cancers (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.48-2.49]), or treated by Medical ICU (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.42-1.86]), Hematology-Oncology (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.33-1.98]) and Cardiac Care Unit-Heart Failure (HR 1.41 [95% CI 1.15-1.72]).Decisions to reverse or limit treatment goals occurs after more than 1 in 13 trials of LST, and is associated with older female patients, receiving non-ventilator forms of LST, cerebrovascular disease, and treatment by certain medical specialty services.

These interactions offer insights into the mechanisms behind higher order biochemical phenomena, such as drug-drug interactions and variations in drug response across individuals. To assist their curation at scale, we must understand what relationship types are possible and map unstructured natural language descriptions onto these structured classes.Methods: We used NCBI's PubTator annotations to identify instances of chemical, gene and disease names in Medline abstracts and applied the Stanford dependency parser to find connecting dependency paths between pairs of entities in single sentences. We combined a published ensemble biclustering algorithm (EBC) with hierarchical clustering to group the dependency paths into semantically-related categories, which we annotated with labels, or \"themes\" (\"inhibition\" and \"activation\", for example). We evaluated our theme assignments against six human-curated databases: DrugBank, Reactome, SIDER, the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), OMIM, and PharmGKB.Results: Clustering revealed 10 broad themes for chemical-gene relationships, 7 for chemical-disease, 10 for gene-disease and 9 for gene-gene. In most cases, enriched themes corresponded directly to known database relationships. Our final dataset, represented as a network, contained 37,491 thematically-labeled chemical-gene edges, 2,021,192 chemical-disease edges, 136,206 gene-disease edges, and 41,418 gene-gene edges, each representing a single-sentence description of an interaction from somewhere in the literature.Availability: The complete network is available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/1035500). We have also provided the full set of dependency paths connecting biomedical entities in Medline abstracts, with associated sentences, for future use by the biomedical research community.Contact: bethany.percha@mssm.edu.Supplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Leading institutions have begun to implement PGx testing and the amount of published PGx literature increases yearly. The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB; www.pharmgkb.org) is one of the foremost worldwide resources for PGx knowledge, and the organization has been adapting and refocusing its mission along with the current revolution in genomic medicine. The PharmGKB website provides a diverse array of PGx information, from annotations of the primary literature to guidelines for adjusting drug treatment based on genetic information. It is freely available and accessible to everyone from researchers to clinicians to everyday citizens. PharmGKB was found over 17years ago, but continues to be a vital resource for the entire PGx community and the general public.

View details for PubMedID 29474005 Biomarkers are the pillars of precision medicine and are delivering on expectations of molecular, quantitative health. These features have made clinical decisions more precise and personalized, but require a high bar for validation. Biomarkers have improved health outcomes in a few areas such as cancer, pharmacogenetics, and safety. Burgeoning big data research infrastructure, the internet of things, and increased patient participation will accelerate discovery in the many areas that have not yet realized the full potential of biomarkers for precision health. Here we review themes of biomarker discovery, current implementations of biomarkers for precision health, and future opportunities and challenges for biomarker discovery. Impact statement Precision medicine evolved because of the understanding that human disease is molecularly driven and is highly variable across patients. This understanding has made biomarkers, a diverse class of biological measurements, more relevant for disease diagnosis, monitoring, and selection of treatment strategy. Biomarkers' impact on precision medicine can be seen in cancer, pharmacogenomics, and safety. The successes in these cases suggest many more applications for biomarkers and a greater impact for precision medicine across the spectrum of human disease. The authors assess the status of biomarker-guided medical practice by analyzing themes for biomarker discovery, reviewing the impact of these markers in the clinic, and highlight future and ongoing challenges for biomarker discovery. This work is timely and relevant, as the molecular, quantitative approach of precision medicine is spreading to many disease indications.

Translational researchers therefore must integrate information at multiple scales to both generate and test hypotheses-to some extent they must all be comfortable with the basics of \"big data\" analyses. This increased focus on data-driven science requires an understanding of basic experimental and clinical data collection-understanding that likely cannot efficiently be gathered through traditional apprenticeship models. Thus, new curricula are required to ensure that next-generation scientists have a new combination of skills required for integrating data to catalyze discovery. View details for PubMedID 29134624 Transcription factors (TFs), the key players in transcriptional regulation, have attracted great experimental attention, yet the functions of most human TFs remain poorly understood. Recent capabilities in genome-wide protein binding profiling have stimulated systematic studies of the hierarchical organization of human gene regulatory network and DNA-binding specificity of TFs, shedding light on combinatorial gene regulation. We show here that these data also enable a systematic annotation of the biological functions and functional diversity of TFs.We compiled a human gene regulatory network for 384 TFs covering the 146,096 TF-target gene (TF-TG) relationships, extracted from over 850 ChIP-seq experiments as well as the literature. By integrating this network of TF-TF and TF-TG relationships with 3715 functional concepts from six sources of gene function annotations, we obtained over 9000 confident functional annotations for 279 TFs. We observe extensive connectivity between TFs and Mendelian diseases, GWAS phenotypes, and pharmacogenetic pathways. Further, we show that TFs link apparently unrelated functions, even when the two functions do not share common genes. Finally, we analyze the pleiotropic functions of TFs and suggest that the increased number of upstream regulators contributes to the functional pleiotropy of TFs.Our computational approach is complementary to focused experimental studies on TF functions, and the resulting knowledge can guide experimental design for the discovery of unknown roles of TFs in human disease and drug response.

For example, the drug digoxin is reduced to the inactive metabolite dihydrodigoxin by the gut Actinobacterium E. lenta, and patients colonized with high levels of drug metabolizing strains may have limited response to the drug. Understanding the complete space of drugs that are metabolized by the human gut microbiome is critical for predicting bacteria-drug relationships and their effects on individual patient response. Discovery and validation of drug metabolism via bacterial enzymes has yielded >50 drugs after nearly a century of experimental research. However, there are limited computational tools for screening drugs for potential metabolism by the gut microbiome. We developed a pipeline for comparing and characterizing chemical transformations using continuous vector representations of molecular structure learned using unsupervised representation learning. We applied this pipeline to chemical reaction data from MetaCyc to characterize the utility of vector representations for chemical reaction transformations. After clustering molecular and reaction vectors, we performed enrichment analyses and queries to characterize the space. We detected enriched enzyme names, Gene Ontology terms, and Enzyme Consortium (EC) classes within reaction clusters. In addition, we queried reactions against drug-metabolite transformations known to be metabolized by the human gut microbiome. The top results for these known drug transformations contained similar substructure modifications to the original drug pair. This work enables high throughput screening of drugs and their resulting metabolites against chemical reactions common to gut bacteria.

With the rise in text mining approaches, the volume of such biomedical data is rapidly increasing, thereby creating a new problem for the users of this data: information overload. A tool for efficient querying and visualization of biomedical data that helps researchers understand the underlying biological mechanisms for diseases and drug responses, and ultimately helps patients, is sorely needed. To this end we have developed GeneDive, a web-based information retrieval, filtering, and visualization tool for large volumes of gene interaction data. GeneDive offers various features and modalities that guide the user through the search process to efficiently reach the information of their interest. GeneDive currently processes over three million gene-gene interactions with response times within a few seconds. For over half of the curated gene sets sourced from four prominent databases, more than 80% of the gene set members are recovered by GeneDive. In the near future, GeneDive will seamlessly accommodate other interaction types, such as gene-drug and gene-disease interactions, thus enabling full exploration of topics such as precision medicine.

However, these ML methods are inherently complex and often difficult to understand and explain resulting in barriers to their adoption and validation. Our work (RFEX) focuses on enhancing Random Forest (RF) classifier explainability by developing easy to interpret explainability summary reports from trained RF classifiers as a way to improve the explainability for (often non-expert) users. RFEX is implemented and extensively tested on Stanford FEATURE data where RF is tasked with predicting functional sites in 3D molecules based on their electrochemical signatures (features). In developing RFEX method we apply user-centered approach driven by explainability questions and requirements collected by discussions with interested practitioners. We performed formal usability testing with 13 expert and non-expert users to verify RFEX usefulness. Analysis of RFEX explainability report and user feedback indicates its usefulness in significantly increasing explainability and user confidence in RF classification on FEATURE data. Notably, RFEX summary reports easily reveal that one needs very few (from 2-6 depending on a model) top ranked features to achieve 90% or better of the accuracy when all 480 features are used.

We hypothesize that distributional semantics can speed up lexicon expansion in a clinical domain, radiology, by unearthing synonyms from the corpus.We apply word2vec, a distributional semantics software package, to the text of radiology notes to identify synonyms for RadLex, a structured lexicon of radiology terms. We stratify performance by term category, term frequency, number of tokens in the term, vector magnitude, and the context window used in vector building.Ranking candidates based on distributional similarity to a target term results in high curation efficiency: on a ranked list of 775 249 terms, >50% of synonyms occurred within the first 25 terms. Synonyms are easier to find if the target term is a phrase rather than a single word, if it occurs at least 100\u00d7 in the corpus, and if its vector magnitude is between 4 and 5. Some RadLex categories, such as anatomical substances, are easier to identify synonyms for than others.The unstructured text of clinical notes contains a wealth of information about human diseases and treatment patterns. However, searching and retrieving information from clinical notes often suffer due to variations in how similar concepts are described in the text. Biomedical lexicons address this challenge, but are expensive to produce and maintain. Distributional semantics algorithms can assist lexicon curation, saving researchers time and money.

However, how histopathology findings relate to molecular abnormalities remains largely unknown. Here, we obtained H&E-stained whole-slide histopathology images, pathology reports, RNA sequencing, and proteomics data of 538 lung adenocarcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and used these to identify molecular pathways associated with histopathology patterns. We report cell-cycle regulation and nucleotide binding pathways underpinning tumor cell dedifferentiation, and we predicted histology grade using transcriptomics and proteomics signatures (area under curve >0.80). We built an integrative histopathology-transcriptomics model to generate better prognostic predictions for stage I patients (p = 0.0182 \u00b1 0.0021) compared with gene expression or histopathology studies alone, and the results were replicated in an independent cohort (p = 0.0220 \u00b1 0.0070). These results motivate the integration of histopathology and omics data to investigate molecular mechanisms of pathology findings and enhance clinical prognostic prediction.

We prospectively studied medication changes made by providers representing eight different medicine specialty clinics whose patients had submitted to preemptive pharmacogenomic genotyping. An institutional clinical decision support (CDS) system provided pharmacogenomic results using traffic light alerts: green = genomically favorable, yellow = genomic caution, red = high risk. The influence of pharmacogenomic alerts on prescribing behaviors was the primary endpoint. In all, 2,279 outpatient encounters were analyzed. Independent of other potential prescribing mediators, medications with high pharmacogenomic risk were changed significantly more often than prescription drugs lacking pharmacogenomic information (odds ratio (OR) = 26.2 (9.0-75.3), P < 0.0001). Medications with cautionary pharmacogenomic information were also changed more frequently (OR = 2.4 (1.7-3.5), P < 0.0001). No pharmacogenomically high-risk medications were prescribed during the entire study when physicians consulted the CDS tool. Pharmacogenomic information improved prescribing in patterns aimed at reducing patient risk, demonstrating that enhanced prescription decision-making is achievable through clinical integration of genomic medicine.

The Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) is a community experiment consisting of genotype-phenotype prediction challenges; participants build models, undergo assessment, and share key findings. For CAGI 4, three challenges involved using exome-sequencing data: Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and warfarin dosing.

Additionally, we outline some of the difficulties associated with making predictions and evaluating them. The lessons learned from the exome challenges can be applied to both research and clinical efforts to improve phenotype prediction from genotype. In addition, these challenges serve as a vehicle for sharing clinical and research exome data in a secure manner with scientists who have a broad range of expertise, contributing to a collaborative effort to advance our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships.

Support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks are currently among the most popular and accurate QSAR methods because they learn new representations of the data that greatly improve modelability. In this work, we use shallow representation learning to improve the accuracy of L1 regularized logistic regression (LASSO) and meet the performance of Tanimoto SVM. We embedded chemical fingerprints in Euclidean space using Tanimoto (a.k.a. Jaccard) similarity kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and compared the effects on LASSO and SVM model performance for predicting the binding activities of chemical compounds against 102 virtual screening targets. We observed similar performance and patterns of improvement for LASSO and SVM. We also empirically measured model training and cross-validation times to show that KPCA used in concert with LASSO classification is significantly faster than linear SVM over a wide range of training set sizes. Our work shows that powerful linear QSAR methods can match nonlinear methods and demonstrates a modular approach to nonlinear classification that greatly enhances QSAR model prototyping facility, flexibility, and transferability.

The surfeit of protein structural data enables development of computational methods to systematically derive rules governing structural-functional relationships. However, performance of these methods depends critically on the choice of protein structural representation. Most current methods rely on features that are manually selected based on knowledge about protein structures. These are often general-purpose but not optimized for the specific application of interest. In this paper, we present a general framework that applies 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) technology to structure-based protein analysis. The framework automatically extracts task-specific features from the raw atom distribution, driven by supervised labels. As a pilot study, we use our network to analyze local protein microenvironments surrounding the 20 amino acids, and predict the amino acids most compatible with environments within a protein structure. To further validate the power of our method, we construct two amino acid substitution matrices from the prediction statistics and use them to predict effects of mutations in T4 lysozyme structures.Our deep 3DCNN achieves a two-fold increase in prediction accuracy compared to models that employ conventional hand-engineered features and successfully recapitulates known information about similar and different microenvironments. Models built from our predictions and substitution matrices achieve an 85% accuracy predicting outcomes of the T4 lysozyme mutation variants. Our substitution matrices contain rich information relevant to mutation analysis compared to well-established substitution matrices. Finally, we present a visualization method to inspect the individual contributions of each atom to the classification decisions.End-to-end trained deep learning networks consistently outperform methods using hand-engineered features, suggesting that the 3DCNN framework is well suited for analysis of protein microenvironments and may be useful for other protein structural analyses.

Estimate the \"decay rate\" of clinical data source relevance.We trained a clinical order recommender system, analogous to Netflix or Amazon's \"Customers who bought A also bought B...\" product recommenders, based on a tertiary academic hospital's structured electronic health record data. We used this system to predict future (2013) admission orders based on different subsets of historical training data (2009 through 2012), relative to existing human-authored order sets.Predicting future (2013) inpatient orders is more accurate with models trained on just one month of recent (2012) data than with 12 months of older (2009) data (ROC AUC 0.91 vs. 0.88, precision 27% vs. 22%, recall 52% vs. 43%, all P<10(-10)). Algorithmically learned models from even the older (2009) data was still more effective than existing human-authored order sets (ROC AUC 0.81, precision 16% recall 35%). Training with more longitudinal data (2009-2012) was no better than using only the most recent (2012) data, unless applying a decaying weighting scheme with a \"half-life\" of data relevance about 4 months.Clinical practice patterns (automatically) learned from electronic health record data can vary substantially across years. Gold standards for clinical decision support are elusive moving targets, reinforcing the need for automated methods that can adapt to evolving information.Prioritizing small amounts of recent data is more effective than using larger amounts of older data towards future clinical predictions.

However, developing treatments for these diseases remains challenging. In fact, when we systematically analyze the US FDA orphan drug list, we find that only 8% of rare diseases have an FDA-designated drug. Our approach leverages three primary insights: first, diseases with gain-of-function mutations and late onset are more likely to have drug options; second, drugs are more often inhibitors than activators; and third, some disease-causing proteins can be rescued by allosteric activators in diseases due to loss-of-function mutations.We have developed a pipeline that combines natural language processing and human curation to mine promising targets for drug development from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. This pipeline targets diseases caused by well-characterized gain-of-function mutations or loss-of-function proteins with known allosteric activators. Applying this pipeline across thousands of rare genetic diseases, we discover 34 rare genetic diseases that are promising candidates for drug development.Our analysis has revealed uneven coverage of rare diseases in the current US FDA orphan drug space. Diseases with gain-of-function mutations or loss-of-function mutations and known allosteric activators should be prioritized for drug treatments.

We engineered features from these reports and constructed random forest, L1 regularized logistic regression, and support vector machine models. We evaluated model accuracy and further assessed utility by generating report rankings that represented a prioritized report review process.Our random forest model showed the best performance in report ranking and accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.66. The generated report ordering assigns reports with a higher probability of medication-related causality a higher rank and is significantly correlated to a perfect report ordering, with a Kendall's tau of 0.24 ( P = .002).Our models produced prioritized report orderings that enable FDA safety evaluators to focus on reports that are more likely to contain valuable medication-related adverse event information. Applying our models to all FDA adverse event reports has the potential to streamline the manual review process and greatly reduce reviewer workload.

Many studies use GEO data to shape hypotheses and improve statistical power. Within GEO, the Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133 Plus 2.0 are the two most commonly used microarray platforms for human samples; the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform contains 54 220 probes and the HG-U133A array contains a proper subset (21 722 probes). When different platforms are involved, the subset of common genes is most easily compared. This approach results in the exclusion of substantial measured data and can limit downstream analysis. To predict the expression values for the genes unique to the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform, we constructed a series of gene expression inference models based on genes common to both platforms. Our model predicts gene expression values that are within the variability observed in controlled replicate studies and are highly correlated with measured data. Using six previously published studies, we also demonstrate the improved performance of the enlarged feature space generated by our model in downstream analysis.The gene inference model described in this paper is available as a R package (affyImpute), which can be downloaded at http://simtk.org/home/affyimpute.rbaltman@stanford.edu.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

The Translational Pharmacogenetics Program (TPP) of the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research Network was established in 2011 to catalog and contribute to the development of pharmacogenetic implementations at eight US healthcare systems, with the goal to disseminate real-world solutions for the barriers to clinical pharmacogenetic implementation. The TPP collected and normalized pharmacogenetic implementation metrics through June 2015, including gene-drug pairs implemented, interpretations of alleles and diplotypes, numbers of tests performed and actionable results, and workflow diagrams. TPP participant institutions developed diverse solutions to overcome many barriers, but the use of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines provided some consistency among the institutions. The TPP also collected some pharmacogenetic implementation outcomes (scientific, educational, financial, and informatics), which may inform healthcare systems seeking to implement their own pharmacogenetic testing programs.

Mapping genetic variation to genes improves power and allows the effects of both protein-coding variation as well as variation in expression to be combined into \"gene level\" effects.Previous work has shown that warfarin dose can be predicted using information from genetic variation that affects protein-coding regions. Here, we introduce a method that improves dose prediction by integrating tissue-specific gene expression. In particular, we use drug pathways and expression quantitative trait loci knowledge to impute gene expression-on the assumption that differential expression of key pathway genes may impact dose requirement. We focus on 116 genes from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways of warfarin within training and validation sets comprising both European and African-descent individuals.We build gene-tissue signatures associated with warfarin dose in a cohort-specific manner and identify a signature of 11 gene-tissue pairs that significantly augments the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium dosage-prediction algorithm in both populations.Our results demonstrate that imputed expression can improve dose prediction and bridge population-specific compositions.

View details for PubMedID 29178968 Studying analog series to find structural transformations that enhance the activity and ADME properties of lead compounds is an important part of drug development. Matched molecular pair (MMP) search is a powerful tool for analog analysis that imitates researchers' ability to select pairs of compounds that differ only by small well-defined transformations. Abstraction is a challenge for existing MMP search algorithms, which can result in the omission of relevant, inexact MMPs, and inclusion of irrelevant, contextually dissimilar MMPs. In this work, we present a new method for MMP search that returns approximate results and enables flexible control over abstraction of contextual information. We illustrate the concepts and mechanics of our method with a series of exemplar MMP queries, and then benchmark search accuracy using MMPs found by fragment indexing. We show that we can search for MMPs in a context dependent manner, and accurately approximate context independent fragment index based MMP search over a range of fingerprint and dataset conditions. Our method can be used to search for pairwise correspondences among analog sets and bolster MMP datasets where data is missing or incomplete.

However, the utility of pathway-based analysis tools is hampered by undercuration and reliance on a distribution of signal across all of the genes in a pathway. Methods that combine genome wide association results with genetic networks to infer the key phenotype-modulating subnetworks combat these issues, but have primarily been limited to network definitions with yes/no labels for gene-gene interactions. A recent method (EW_dmGWAS) incorporates a biological network with weighted edge probability by requiring a secondary phenotype-specific expression dataset. In this article, we combine an algorithm for weighted-edge module searching and a probabilistic interaction network in order to develop a method, STAMS, for recovering modules of genes with strong associations to the phenotype and probable biologic coherence. Our method builds on EW_dmGWAS but does not require a secondary expression dataset and performs better in six test cases.We show that our algorithm improves over EW_dmGWAS and standard gene-based analysis by measuring precision and recall of each method on separately identified associations. In the Wellcome Trust Rheumatoid Arthritis study, STAMS-identified modules were more enriched for separately identified associations than EW_dmGWAS (STAMS P-value 3.0 \u00d7 10(-4); EW_dmGWAS- P-value = 0.8). We demonstrate that the area under the Precision-Recall curve is 5.9 times higher with STAMS than EW_dmGWAS run on the Wellcome Trust Type 1 Diabetes data.STAMS is implemented as an R package and is freely available at https://simtk.org/projects/stams CONTACT: rbaltman@stanford.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

View details for PubMedID 27797771 We report a simple model that predicts the maximum recommended therapeutic dose (MRTD) of small molecule drugs based on an assessment of likely protein-drug interactions. Previously, we reported methods for computational estimation of drug promiscuity and potency. We used these concepts to build a linear model derived from 238 small molecular drugs to predict MRTD. We applied this model successfully to predict MRTDs for 16 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 14 antiretroviral drugs. Of note, based on the estimated promiscuity of low-dose drugs (and active chemicals), we identified 83 proteins as \"high-risk off-targets\" (HROTs) that are often associated with low doses; the evaluation of interactions with HROTs may be useful during early phases of drug discovery. Our model helps explain the MRTD for drugs with severe adverse reactions caused by interactions with HROTs.

Drawing an analogy between structured items (e.g., clinical orders) to words in a text document, the authors performed latent Dirichlet allocation probabilistic topic modeling. These topic models use initial clinical information to predict clinical orders for a separate validation set of > 4 K patients. The authors evaluated these topic model-based predictions vs existing human-authored order sets by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, and recall for subsequent clinical orders.Existing order sets predict clinical orders used within 24 hours with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.81, precision 16%, and recall 35%. This can be improved to 0.90, 24%, and 47% ( P < 10 -20 ) by using probabilistic topic models to summarize clinical data into up to 32 topics. Many of these latent topics yield natural clinical interpretations (e.g., \"critical care,\" \"pneumonia,\" \"neurologic evaluation\").Existing order sets tend to provide nonspecific, process-oriented aid, with usability limitations impairing more precise, patient-focused support. Algorithmic summarization has the potential to breach this usability barrier by automatically inferring patient context, but with potential tradeoffs in interpretability.Probabilistic topic modeling provides an automated approach to detect thematic trends in patient care and generate decision support content. A potential use case finds related clinical orders for decision support.

However, the typical genetic risk factors in populations of European descent are nearly absent in African Americans, and population-specific genetic factors influencing the higher VTE rate are not well characterized.We performed a candidate gene analysis on an exome-sequenced African American family with recurrent VTE and identified a variant in Protein S (PROS1) V510M (rs138925964). We assessed the population impact of PROS1 V510M using a multicenter African American cohort of 306 cases with VTE compared to 370 controls. Additionally, we compared our case cohort to a background population cohort of 2203 African Americans in the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP).In the African American family with recurrent VTE, we found prior laboratories for our cases indicating low free Protein S levels, providing functional support for PROS1 V510M as the causative mutation. Additionally, this variant was significantly enriched in the VTE cases of our multicenter case-control study (Fisher's Exact Test, P = 0.0041, OR = 4.62, 95% CI: 1.51-15.20; allele frequencies - cases: 2.45%, controls: 0.54%). Similarly, PROS1 V510M was also enriched in our VTE case cohort compared to African Americans in the ESP cohort (Fisher's Exact Test, P = 0.010, OR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.26-4.10).We found a variant, PROS1 V510M, in an African American family with VTE and clinical laboratory abnormalities in Protein S. Additionally, we found that this variant conferred increased risk of VTE in a case-control study of African Americans. In the ESP cohort, the variant is nearly absent in ESP European descent subjects (n = 3, allele frequency: 0.03%). Additionally, in 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data, the variant only appears in African descent populations. Thus, PROS1 V510M is a population-specific genetic risk factor for VTE in African Americans.

At present, it is not possible to predict which patients will be affected by doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). Here we demonstrate that patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) can recapitulate the predilection to DIC of individual patients at the cellular level. hiPSC-CMs derived from individuals with breast cancer who experienced DIC were consistently more sensitive to doxorubicin toxicity than hiPSC-CMs from patients who did not experience DIC, with decreased cell viability, impaired mitochondrial and metabolic function, impaired calcium handling, decreased antioxidant pathway activity, and increased reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, our data indicate that hiPSC-CMs are a suitable platform to identify and characterize the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of DIC.

In this work we study the relationship between disease co-occurrence and commonly shared genetic architecture of disease. Records of pairs of diseases were combined from two different electronic medical systems (Columbia, Stanford), and compared to a large database of published disease-associated genetic variants (VARIMED); data on 35 disorders were available across all three sources, which include medical records for over 1.2 million patients and variants from over 17,000 publications. Based on the sources in which they appeared, disease pairs were categorized as having predominant clinical, genetic, or both kinds of manifestations. Confounding effects of age on disease incidence were controlled for by only comparing diseases when they fall in the same cluster of similarly shaped incidence patterns. We find that disease pairs that are overrepresented in both electronic medical record systems and in VARIMED come from two main disease classes, autoimmune and neuropsychiatric. We furthermore identify specific genes that are shared within these disease groups.

Association statistics were counted for the \u223c1.5K most common items to drive an order recommender. The authors assessed the recommender's ability to predict hospital admission orders and outcomes based on initial encounter data from separate validation patients.Compared to a reference benchmark of using the overall most common orders, the recommender using temporal relationships improves precision at 10 recommendations from 33% to 38% (P < 10(-10)) for hospital admission orders. Relative risk-based association methods improve inverse frequency weighted recall from 4% to 16% (P < 10(-16)). The framework yields a prediction receiver operating characteristic area under curve (c-statistic) of 0.84 for 30 day mortality, 0.84 for 1 week need for ICU life support, 0.80 for 1 week hospital discharge, and 0.68 for 30-day readmission.Recommender results quantitatively improve on reference benchmarks and qualitatively appear clinically reasonable. The method assumes that aggregate decision making converges appropriately, but ongoing evaluation is necessary to discern common behaviors from \"correct\" ones.Collaborative filtering recommender algorithms generate clinical decision support that is predictive of real practice patterns and clinical outcomes. Incorporating temporal relationships improves accuracy. Different evaluation metrics satisfy different goals (predicting likely events vs. \"interesting\" suggestions).

Transcriptome profiling can potentially provide key insights on the pathogenesis of diseases, but the signals from the disease causes and consequences are intertwined, leaving it to speculations what are likely causal. Genome-wide association study on the other hand provides direct evidences on the potential genetic causes of diseases, but it does not provide a comprehensive view of disease pathogenesis, and it has difficulties in detecting the weak signals from individual genes. Here we propose an approach diseaseExPatho that combines transcriptome data, regulome knowledge, and GWAS results if available, for separating the causes and consequences in the disease transcriptome. DiseaseExPatho computationally deconvolutes the expression data into gene expression modules, hierarchically ranks the modules based on regulome using a novel algorithm, and given GWAS data, it directly labels the potential causal gene modules based on their correlations with genome-wide gene-disease associations. Strikingly, we observed that the putative causal modules are not necessarily differentially expressed in disease, while the other modules can show strong differential expression without enrichment of top GWAS variations. On the other hand, we showed that the regulatory network based module ranking prioritized the putative causal modules consistently in 6 diseases. We suggest that the approach is applicable to other common and rare complex diseases to prioritize causal pathways with or without genome-wide association studies.

Our objective is to determine the stability of learned clinical practice patterns over time and what implication this has when using varying longitudinal historical data sources towards predicting future decisions. We trained an association rule engine for clinical orders (e.g., labs, imaging, medications) using structured inpatient data from a tertiary academic hospital. Comparing top order associations per admission diagnosis from training data in 2009 vs. 2012, we find practice variability from unstable diagnoses with rank biased overlap (RBO)<0.35 (e.g., pneumonia) to stable admissions for planned procedures (e.g., chemotherapy, surgery) with comparatively high RBO>0.6. Predicting admission orders for future (2013) patients with associations trained on recent (2012) vs. older (2009) data improved accuracy evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) 0.89 to 0.92, precision at ten (positive predictive value of the top ten predictions against actual orders) 30% to 37%, and weighted recall (sensitivity) at ten 2.4% to 13%, (P<10(-10)). Training with more longitudinal data (2009-2012) was no better than only using recent (2012) data. Secular trends in practice patterns likely explain why smaller but more recent training data is more accurate at predicting future practices.

In doing so we identify clinically actionable inherited disease risk and drug response genotypes in pre-symptomatic individuals. We also nominate a new candidate gene in congenital arrhythmia, ATP2B4, and provide experimental evidence of a regulatory role for variants discovered using this framework.

Among the various biologically active metal ions, calcium plays a large role in regulating cellular and physiological changes. With the increasing number of high-quality crystal structures of proteins associated with their metal ion ligands, many groups have built models to identify Ca(2+) sites in proteins, utilizing information such as structure, geometry, or homology to do the inference. We present a FEATURE-based approach in building such a model and show that our model is able to discriminate between nonsites and calcium-binding sites with a very high precision of more than 98%. We demonstrate the high specificity of our model by applying it to test sets constructed from other ions. We also introduce an algorithm to convert high scoring regions into specific site predictions and demonstrate the usage by scanning a test set of 91 calcium-binding protein structures (190 calcium sites). The algorithm has a recall of more than 93% on the test set with predictions found within 3 \u00c5 of the actual sites.

We take a first step toward this goal by extending an existing autism ontology to allow automatic inference of ASD phenotypes and Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria based on subjects' Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessment data.Knowledge regarding diagnostic instruments, ASD phenotypes and risk factors was added to augment an existing autism ontology via Ontology Web Language class definitions and semantic web rules. We developed a custom Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 plugin for enumerating combinatorial OWL axioms to support the many-to-many relations of ADI-R items to diagnostic categories in the DSM. We utilized a reasoner to infer whether 2642 subjects, whose data was obtained from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, meet DSM-IV-TR (DSM-IV) and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria based on their ADI-R data.We extended the ontology by adding 443 classes and 632 rules that represent phenotypes, along with their synonyms, environmental risk factors, and frequency of comorbidities. Applying the rules on the data set showed that the method produced accurate results: the true positive and true negative rates for inferring autistic disorder diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria were 1 and 0.065, respectively; the true positive rate for inferring ASD based on DSM-5 criteria was 0.94.The ontology allows automatic inference of subjects' disease phenotypes and diagnosis with high accuracy.The ontology may benefit future studies by serving as a knowledge base for ASD. In addition, by adding knowledge of related NDDs, commonalities and differences in manifestations and risk factors could be automatically inferred, contributing to the understanding of ASD pathophysiology.

Previous methods for explaining side-effects have focused on known drug targets and their pathways. However, low affinity binding to proteins that are not usually considered drug targets may also drive side-effects. In order to assess these alternative targets, we used the 3D structures of 563 essential human proteins systematically to predict binding to 216 drugs. We first benchmarked our affinity predictions with available experimental data. We then combined singular value decomposition and canonical component analysis (SVD-CCA) to predict side-effects based on these novel target profiles. Our method predicts side-effects with good accuracy (average AUC: 0.82 for side effects present in <50% of drug labels). We also noted that side-effect frequency is the most important feature for prediction and can confound efforts at elucidating mechanism; our method allows us to remove the contribution of frequency and isolate novel biological signals. In particular, our analysis produces 2768 triplet associations between 50 essential proteins, 99 drugs, and 77 side-effects. Although experimental validation is difficult because many of our essential proteins do not have validated assays, we nevertheless attempted to validate a subset of these associations using experimental assay data. Our focus on essential proteins allows us to find potential associations that would likely be missed if we used recognized drug targets. Our associations provide novel insights about the molecular mechanisms of drug side-effects and highlight the need for expanded experimental efforts to investigate drug binding to proteins more broadly.

Several sequencing-based assays continue to provide coverage that is inadequate for clinical assessment.Using sequence data obtained from the NA12878 reference sample and pre-defined lists of medically-relevant protein-coding and noncoding sequences, we compared the breadth and depth of coverage obtained among four commercial exome capture platforms and whole genome sequencing. In addition, we evaluated the performance of an augmented exome strategy, ACE, that extends coverage in medically relevant regions and enhances coverage in areas that are challenging to sequence. Leveraging reference call-sets, we also examined the effects of improved coverage on variant detection sensitivity.We observed coverage shortfalls with each of the conventional exome-capture and whole-genome platforms across several medically interpretable genes. These gaps included areas of the genome required for reporting recently established secondary findings (ACMG) and known disease-associated loci. The augmented exome strategy recovered many of these gaps, resulting in improved coverage in these areas. At clinically-relevant coverage levels (100 % bases covered at \u226520\u00d7), ACE improved coverage among genes in the medically interpretable genome (>90 % covered relative to 10-78 % with other platforms), the set of ACMG secondary finding genes (91 % covered relative to 4-75 % with other platforms) and a subset of variants known to be associated with human disease (99 % covered relative to 52-95 % with other platforms). Improved coverage translated into improvements in sensitivity, with ACE variant detection sensitivities (>97.5 % SNVs, >92.5 % InDels) exceeding that observed with conventional whole-exome and whole-genome platforms.Clinicians should consider analytical performance when making clinical assessments, given that even a few missed variants can lead to reporting false negative results. An augmented exome strategy provides a level of coverage not achievable with other platforms, thus addressing concerns regarding the lack of sensitivity in clinically important regions. In clinical applications where comprehensive coverage of medically interpretable areas of the genome requires higher localized sequencing depth, an augmented exome approach offers both cost and performance advantages over other sequencing-based tests.

Unfortunately, this information is distributed throughout the unstructured text of over 23 million articles. The creation of structured resources that catalog the relationships between drugs and genes would accelerate the translation of basic molecular knowledge into discoveries of genomic biomarkers for drug response and prediction of unexpected drug-drug interactions. Extracting these relationships from natural language sentences on such a large scale, however, requires text mining algorithms that can recognize when different-looking statements are expressing similar ideas. Here we describe a novel algorithm, Ensemble Biclustering for Classification (EBC), that learns the structure of biomedical relationships automatically from text, overcoming differences in word choice and sentence structure. We validate EBC's performance against manually-curated sets of (1) pharmacogenomic relationships from PharmGKB and (2) drug-target relationships from DrugBank, and use it to discover new drug-gene relationships for both knowledge bases. We then apply EBC to map the complete universe of drug-gene relationships based on their descriptions in Medline, revealing unexpected structure that challenges current notions about how these relationships are expressed in text. For instance, we learn that newer experimental findings are described in consistently different ways than established knowledge, and that seemingly pure classes of relationships can exhibit interesting chimeric structure. The EBC algorithm is flexible and adaptable to a wide range of problems in biomedical text mining.

Literature supporting each drug/variant pair was assessed for study design and methods, outcomes, statistical significance, and clinical relevance. Proposed clinical summaries were formally scored using a modified AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) II instrument, including recommendation for or against guideline implementation.Positive pharmacogenomic findings were identified for 51 of 71 cardiovascular drugs (71.8%), representing 884 unique drug/variant pairs from 597 publications. After analysis for quality and clinical relevance, 92 drug/variant pairs were proposed for translation into clinical summaries, encompassing 23 drugs (32.4% of drugs reviewed). All were recommended for clinical implementation using AGREE II, with mean \u00b1 SD overall quality scores of 5.18\u00b10.91 (of 7.0; range, 3.67-7.0). Drug guidelines had highest mean \u00b1 SD scores in AGREE II domain 1 (Scope) (91.9\u00b16.1 of 100) and moderate but still robust mean \u00b1 SD scores in domain 3 (Rigor) (73.1\u00b111.1), domain 4 (Clarity) (67.8\u00b112.5), and domain 5 (Applicability) (65.8\u00b110.0). Clopidogrel (CYP2C19), metoprolol (CYP2D6), simvastatin (rs4149056), dabigatran (rs2244613), hydralazine (rs1799983, rs1799998), and warfarin (CYP2C9/VKORC1) were distinguished by the highest scores. Seven of the 9 most commonly prescribed drugs warranted translation guidelines summarizing clinical pharmacogenomic information.Considerable clinically actionable pharmacogenomic information for cardiovascular drugs exists, supporting the idea that consideration of such information when prescribing is warranted.

This review examines NGS program challenges through a synthesis of published literature, website and conference presentation content, and interviews at early-adopting institutions in the USA. Institutions are proactively addressing policy challenges related to the management and technical aspects of program development. However, ethical challenges related to patient-related aspects have not been fully addressed. These complex challenges present opportunities to develop comprehensive and standardized regulations across programs. Understanding the strengths, weaknesses and current practices of evolving NGS program approaches are important considerations for institutions developing NGS services, policymakers regulating or funding NGS programs and physicians and patients considering NGS services.

The International SSRI Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ISPC) was formed with the primary goal of identifying genetic variation that may contribute to response to SSRI treatment of major depressive disorder. A genome-wide association study of 4-week treatment outcomes, measured using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17), was performed using data from 865 subjects from seven sites. The primary outcomes were percent change in HRSD-17 score and response, defined as at least 50% reduction in HRSD-17. Data from two prior studies, the Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomics Study (PGRN-AMPS) and the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, were used for replication, and a meta-analysis of the three studies was performed (N=2394). Although many top association signals in the ISPC analysis map to interesting candidate genes, none were significant at the genome-wide level and the associations were not replicated using PGRN-AMPS and STAR*D data. The top association result in the meta-analysis of response represents SNPs 5\u2032 upstream of the neuregulin-1 gene, NRG1 (P = 1.20E - 06). NRG1 is involved in many aspects of brain development, including neuronal maturation and variations in this gene have been shown to be associated with increased risk for mental disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Replication and functional studies of these findings are warranted.

Targeting the mechanisms of action of proteins involved in bacterial cell division bypasses problems associated with increasingly ineffective variants of older antibiotics; to this end, the essential bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ is a promising target. Recent work on its allosteric inhibitor, PC190723, revealed in vitro activity on Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and in vivo antimicrobial activities. However, the mechanism of drug action and its effect on FtsZ in other bacterial species are unclear. Here, we examine the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket using PocketFEATURE, a statistical method that scores the similarity between pairs of small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structure information about the local microenvironment, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observed that species and nucleotide-binding state have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with substantially disparate microenvironments for bacterial species not from the Staphylococcus genus. Based on PocketFEATURE analysis of MD simulations of S. aureus FtsZ bound to GTP or with mutations that are known to confer PC190723 resistance, we predict that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state. Furthermore, MD simulations of an FtsZ dimer indicated that polymerization may enhance PC190723 binding. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and in different polymerization states, yielding important information for the further development of FtsZ inhibitors.

Clinical decision support constructs like order sets help distribute expertise, but are constrained by knowledge-based development. We previously produced a data-driven order recommender system to automatically generate clinical decision support content from structured electronic medical record data on >19K hospital patients. We now present the first structured validation of such automatically generated content against an objective external standard by assessing how well the generated recommendations correspond to orders referenced as appropriate in clinical practice guidelines. For example scenarios of chest pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and pneumonia in hospital patients, the automated method identifies guideline reference orders with ROC AUCs (c-statistics) (0.89, 0.95, 0.83) that improve upon statistical prevalence benchmarks (0.76, 0.74, 0.73) and pre-existing human-expert authored order sets (0.81, 0.77, 0.73) (P<10(-30) in all cases). We demonstrate that data-driven, automatically generated clinical decision support content can reproduce and optimize top-down constructs like order sets while largely avoiding inappropriate and irrelevant recommendations. This will be even more important when extrapolating to more typical clinical scenarios where well-defined external standards and decision support do not exist.

The DREAM consortium launched an open challenge to foster the development of in silico methods to computationally rank 91 compound pairs, from the most synergistic to the most antagonistic, based on gene-expression profiles of human B cells treated with individual compounds at multiple time points and concentrations. Using scoring metrics based on experimental dose-response curves, we assessed 32 methods (31 community-generated approaches and SynGen), four of which performed significantly better than random guessing. We highlight similarities between the methods. Although the accuracy of predictions was not optimal, we find that computational prediction of compound-pair activity is possible, and that community challenges can be useful to advance the field of in silico compound-synergy prediction.

Here we focus on predicting drug response based on a cohort of genomic, epigenomic and proteomic profiling data sets measured in human breast cancer cell lines. Through a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project, we analyzed a total of 44 drug sensitivity prediction algorithms. The top-performing approaches modeled nonlinear relationships and incorporated biological pathway information. We found that gene expression microarrays consistently provided the best predictive power of the individual profiling data sets; however, performance was increased by including multiple, independent data sets. We discuss the innovations underlying the top-performing methodology, Bayesian multitask MKL, and we provide detailed descriptions of all methods. This study establishes benchmarks for drug sensitivity prediction and identifies approaches that can be leveraged for the development of new methods.

Doses can vary 20-fold between patients, and incorrect dosing can result in serious adverse events. Variation in warfarin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes, such as CYP2C9 and VKORC1, do not fully explain the dose variability in African Americans. To identify additional genetic contributors to warfarin dose, we exome sequenced 103 African Americans on stable doses of warfarin at extremes (\u2264 35 and \u2265 49 mg/week). We found an association between lower warfarin dose and a population-specific regulatory variant, rs7856096 (P = 1.82 \u00d7 10(-8), minor allele frequency = 20.4%), in the folate homeostasis gene folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). We replicated this association in an independent cohort of 372 African American subjects whose stable warfarin doses represented the full dosing spectrum (P = .046). In a combined cohort, adding rs7856096 to the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetic Consortium pharmacogenetic dosing algorithm resulted in a 5.8 mg/week (P = 3.93 \u00d7 10(-5)) decrease in warfarin dose for each allele carried. The variant overlaps functional elements and was associated (P = .01) with FPGS gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from combined HapMap African populations (N = 326).

This incomplete knowledge limits our ability to use mechanistic molecular information rationally to repurpose drugs, understand their side effects, and predict their interactions with other drugs. Here, we present DrugRouter, a novel method for generating drug-specific pathways of action by linking target genes, disease genes, and pharmacogenes using gene interaction networks. We construct pathways for more than a hundred drugs and show that the genes included in our pathways (i) co-occur with the query drug in the literature, (ii) significantly overlap or are adjacent to known drug-response pathways, and (iii) are adjacent to genes that are hits in genome-wide association studies assessing drug response. Finally, these computed pathways suggest novel drug-repositioning opportunities (e.g., statins for follicular thyroid cancer), gene-side effect associations, and gene-drug interactions. Thus, DrugRouter generates hypotheses about drug actions using systems biology data.

Developmental lineage analyses and gene expression studies suggest that distinct progenitor populations are compartmentalized to discrete axial domains in the early otocyst. Here, we conducted highly parallel quantitative RT-PCR measurements on 382 individual cells from the developing otocyst and neuroblast lineages to assay 96 genes representing established otic markers, signaling-pathway-associated transcripts, and novel otic-specific genes. By applying multivariate cluster, principal component, and network analyses to the data matrix, we were able to readily distinguish the delaminating neuroblasts and to describe progressive states of gene expression in this population at single-cell resolution. It further established a three-dimensional model of the otocyst in which each individual cell can be precisely mapped into spatial expression domains. Our bioinformatic modeling revealed spatial dynamics of different signaling pathways active during early neuroblast development and prosensory domain specification.

Without rigorous standards we risk an acceleration of false-positive reports of causality, which would impede the translation of genomic research findings into the clinical diagnostic setting and hinder biological understanding of disease. Here we discuss the key challenges of assessing sequence variants in human disease, integrating both gene-level and variant-level support for causality. We propose guidelines for summarizing confidence in variant pathogenicity and highlight several areas that require further resource development.

Focusing on low-molecular-weight compounds (fragments) can dramatically reduce the chemical search space. However, approaches for determining protein-fragment interactions have limitations. Experimental assays are time-consuming, expensive, and not always applicable. At the same time, computational approaches using physics-based methods have limited accuracy. With increasing high-resolution structural data for protein-ligand complexes, there is now an opportunity for data-driven approaches to fragment binding prediction. We present FragFEATURE, a machine learning approach to predict small molecule fragments preferred by a target protein structure. We first create a knowledge base of protein structural environments annotated with the small molecule substructures they bind. These substructures have low-molecular weight and serve as a proxy for fragments. FragFEATURE then compares the structural environments within a target protein to those in the knowledge base to retrieve statistically preferred fragments. It merges information across diverse ligands with shared substructures to generate predictions. Our results demonstrate FragFEATURE's ability to rediscover fragments corresponding to the ligand bound with 74% precision and 82% recall on average. For many protein targets, it identifies high scoring fragments that are substructures of known inhibitors. FragFEATURE thus predicts fragments that can serve as inputs to fragment-based drug design or serve as refinement criteria for creating target-specific compound libraries for experimental or computational screening.

To compare environmental, phenotypic, socioeconomic and state-policy factors in a unified geospatial framework, we analyzed the spatial incidence patterns of ASD and ID using an insurance claims dataset covering nearly one third of the US population. Following epidemiologic evidence, we used the rate of congenital malformations of the reproductive system as a surrogate for environmental exposure of parents to unmeasured developmental risk factors, including toxins. Adjusted for gender, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geopolitical factors, the ASD incidence rates were strongly linked to population-normalized rates of congenital malformations of the reproductive system in males (an increase in ASD incidence by 283% for every percent increase in incidence of malformations, 95% CI: [91%, 576%], p<6\u00d710(-5)). Such congenital malformations were barely significant for ID (94% increase, 95% CI: [1%, 250%], p = 0.0384). Other congenital malformations in males (excluding those affecting the reproductive system) appeared to significantly affect both phenotypes: 31.8% ASD rate increase (CI: [12%, 52%], p<6\u00d710(-5)), and 43% ID rate increase (CI: [23%, 67%], p<6\u00d710(-5)). Furthermore, the state-mandated rigor of diagnosis of ASD by a pediatrician or clinician for consideration in the special education system was predictive of a considerable decrease in ASD and ID incidence rates (98.6%, CI: [28%, 99.99%], p = 0.02475 and 99% CI: [68%, 99.99%], p = 0.00637 respectively). Thus, the observed spatial variability of both ID and ASD rates is associated with environmental and state-level regulatory factors; the magnitude of influence of compound environmental predictors was approximately three times greater than that of state-level incentives. The estimated county-level random effects exhibited marked spatial clustering, strongly indicating existence of as yet unidentified localized factors driving apparent disease incidence. Finally, we found that the rates of ASD and ID at the county level were weakly but significantly correlated (Pearson product-moment correlation 0.0589, p = 0.00101), while for females the correlation was much stronger (0.197, p<2.26\u00d710(-16)).

Accurate identification of a transcription factor's targets is essential to understanding the role that factors play in disease biology. However, due to a high false positive rate, identifying coherent functional target sets is difficult. We have created an improved mapping of targets by integrating ChIP-Seq data with 423 functional modules derived from 9,395 human expression experiments. We identified 5,002 TF-module relationships, significantly improved TF target prediction, and found 30 high-confidence TF-TF associations, of which 14 are known. Importantly, we also connected TFs to diseases through these functional modules and identified 3,859 significant TF-disease relationships. As an example, we found a link between MEF2A and Crohn's disease, which we validated in an independent expression dataset. These results show the power of combining expression data and ChIP-Seq data to remove noise and better extract the associations between TFs, functional modules, and disease.

We performed a meta-analysis on data from 4,973 tamoxifen-treated patients (12 globally distributed sites). Using strict eligibility requirements (postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, receiving 20 mg/day tamoxifen for 5 years, criterion 1); CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status was associated with poorer invasive disease-free survival (IDFS: hazard ratio = 1.25; 95% confidence interval = 1.06, 1.47; P = 0.009). However, CYP2D6 status was not statistically significant when tamoxifen duration, menopausal status, and annual follow-up were not specified (criterion 2, n = 2,443; P = 0.25) or when no exclusions were applied (criterion 3, n = 4,935; P = 0.38). Although CYP2D6 is a strong predictor of IDFS using strict inclusion criteria, because the results are not robust to inclusion criteria (these were not defined a priori), prospective studies are necessary to fully establish the value of CYP2D6 genotyping in tamoxifen therapy.

CDS development is currently limited by a top-down approach, requiring manual production and limited end-user awareness. A statistical data-mining alternative automatically extracts expertise as association statistics from structured EMR data (>5.4M data elements from >19K inpatient encounters). This powers an order recommendation system analogous to commercial systems (e.g., Amazon.com's \"Customers who bought this\u2026\"). Compared to a standard benchmark, the association method improves order prediction precision from 26% to 37% (p<0.01). Introducing an inverse frequency weighted recall metric demonstrates a quantifiable improvement from 3% to 17% (p<0.01) in recommending more specifically relevant orders. The system also predicts clinical outcomes, such as 30 day mortality and 1 week ICU intervention, with ROC AUC of 0.88 and 0.78 respectively, comparable to state-of-the-art prognosis scores.

We hypothesize that: (i) known drug-binding sites contain advantageous physicochemical properties for drug binding, or \"druggable microenvironments\" and (ii) given a target, the presence of multiple druggable microenvironments similar to those seen previously is associated with a high likelihood of druggability. We developed DrugFEATURE to quantify druggability by assessing the microenvironments in potential small-molecule binding sites. We benchmarked DrugFEATURE using two data sets. One data set measures druggability using NMR-based screening. DrugFEATURE correlates well with this metric. The second data set is based on historical drug discovery outcomes. Using the DrugFEATURE cutoffs derived from the first, we accurately discriminated druggable and difficult targets in the second. We further identified novel druggable transcription factors with implications for cancer therapy. DrugFEATURE provides useful insight for drug discovery, by evaluating druggability and suggesting specific regions for interacting with drug-like molecules.CPT: Pharmacometrics Systems Pharmacology (2014) 3, e93; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.66; published online 22 January 2014.

Given the availability of Direct to Consumer (DTC) genetic testing and the falling cost of whole exome and genome sequencing, individuals will increasingly have the opportunity to analyze their own genomic data. We have developed a web-based tool, PATH-SCAN, which annotates individual genomes and exomes for ClinVar designated pathogenic variants found within the genes from the ACMG guidelines. Because mutations in these genes predispose individuals to conditions with actionable outcomes, our tool will allow individuals or researchers to identify potential risk variants in order to consult physicians or genetic counselors for further evaluation. Moreover, our tool allows individuals to anonymously submit their pathogenic burden, so that we can crowd source the collection of quantitative information regarding the frequency of these variants. We tested our tool on 1092 publicly available genomes from the 1000 Genomes project, 163 genomes from the Personal Genome Project, and 15 genomes from a clinical genome sequencing research project. Excluding the most commonly seen variant in 1000 Genomes, about 20% of all genomes analyzed had a ClinVar designated pathogenic variant that required further evaluation.

We used Google's Exacycle cloud-computing platform to simulate two milliseconds of dynamics of a major drug target, the G-protein-coupled receptor \u03b22AR. Markov state models aggregate independent simulations into a single statistical model that is validated by previous computational and experimental results. Moreover, our models provide an atomistic description of the activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor and reveal multiple activation pathways. Agonists and inverse agonists interact differentially with these pathways, with profound implications for drug design.

Electronic medical records (EMRs) have recently emerged as a powerful new source of information for defining the phenotypic signatures of specific diseases. We investigated how EMR-based text mining and statistical analysis could elucidate the phenotypic boundaries of three important neuropsychiatric illnesses-autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.We analyzed the medical records of over 7000 patients at two facilities using an automated text-processing pipeline to annotate the clinical notes with Unified Medical Language System codes and then searching for enriched codes, and associations among codes, that were representative of the three disorders. We used dimensionality-reduction techniques on individual patient records to understand individual-level phenotypic variation within each disorder, as well as the degree of overlap among disorders.We demonstrate that automated EMR mining can be used to extract relevant drugs and phenotypes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and characteristic patterns of associations among them. Patient-level analyses suggest a clear separation between autism and the other disorders, while revealing significant overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They also enable localization of individual patients within the phenotypic 'landscape' of each disorder.Because EMRs reflect the realities of patient care rather than idealized conceptualizations of disease states, we argue that automated EMR mining can help define the boundaries between different mental illnesses, facilitate cohort building for clinical and genomic studies, and reveal how clear expert-defined disease boundaries are in practice.

Although clinical risk factors have been identified, the syndrome remains unpredictable in an individual patient. Here we used genome-wide association analysis to search for common predisposing genetic variants. Cases of drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (diTdP), treatment tolerant controls, and general population controls were ascertained across multiple sites using common definitions, and genotyped on the Illumina 610k or 1M-Duo BeadChips. Principal Components Analysis was used to select 216 Northwestern European diTdP cases and 771 ancestry-matched controls, including treatment-tolerant and general population subjects. With these sample sizes, there is 80% power to detect a variant at genome-wide significance with minor allele frequency of 10% and conferring an odds ratio of \u22652.7. Tests of association were carried out for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by logistic regression adjusting for gender and population structure. No SNP reached genome wide-significance; the variant with the lowest P value was rs2276314, a non-synonymous coding variant in C18orf21 (p = 3\u00d710(-7), odds ratio = 2, 95% confidence intervals: 1.5-2.6). The haplotype formed by rs2276314 and a second SNP, rs767531, was significantly more frequent in controls than cases (p = 3\u00d710(-9)). Expanding the number of controls and a gene-based analysis did not yield significant associations. This study argues that common genomic variants do not contribute importantly to risk for drug-induced Torsades de Pointes across multiple drugs.

In order to better understand these effects, cellular assays can generate high-throughput measurements of gene expression changes induced by small molecules. However, our understanding of how the chemical features of small molecules influence gene expression is very limited. Therefore, we investigated the extent to which chemical features of small molecules can reliably be associated with significant changes in gene expression. Specifically, we analyzed the gene expression response of rat liver cells to 170 different drugs and searched for genes whose expression could be related to chemical features alone. Surprisingly, we can predict the up-regulation of 87 genes (increased expression of at least 1.5 times compared to controls). We show an average cross-validation predictive area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.7 or greater for each of these 87 genes. We applied our method to an external data set of rat liver gene expression response to a novel drug and achieved an AUROC of 0.7. We also validated our approach by predicting up-regulation of Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) in three drugs known to induce CYP1A2 that were not in our data set. Finally, a detailed analysis of the CYP1A2 predictor allowed us to identify which fragments made significant contributions to the predictive scores.

The emergence of large EHR systems offers the opportunity to integrate population information actively into these tools.Here, we assess the ability of a large corpus of electronic records to predict individual discharge diagnoses. We present a method that exploits similarities between patients along multiple dimensions to predict the eventual discharge diagnoses.Using demographic, initial blood and electrocardiography measurements, as well as medical history of hospitalized patients from two independent hospitals, we obtained high performance in cross-validation (area under the curve >0.88) and correctly predicted at least one diagnosis among the top ten predictions for more than 84% of the patients tested. Importantly, our method provides accurate predictions (>0.86 precision in cross validation) for major disease categories, including infectious and parasitic diseases, endocrine and metabolic diseases and diseases of the circulatory systems. Our performance applies to both chronic and acute diagnoses.Our results suggest that one can harness the wealth of population-based information embedded in electronic health records for patient-specific predictive tasks.

We aimed to identify additional variants contributing to warfarin dose requirements in African Americans. METHODS: We did a genome-wide association study of discovery and replication cohorts. Samples from African-American adults (aged \u226518 years) who were taking a stable maintenance dose of warfarin were obtained at International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) sites and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, AL, USA). Patients enrolled at IWPC sites but who were not used for discovery made up the independent replication cohort. All participants were genotyped. We did a stepwise conditional analysis, conditioning first for VKORC1 -1639G\u2192A, followed by the composite genotype of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. We prespecified a genome-wide significance threshold of p<5\u00d710(-8) in the discovery cohort and p<0\u00b70038 in the replication cohort. FINDINGS: The discovery cohort contained 533 participants and the replication cohort 432 participants. After the prespecified conditioning in the discovery cohort, we identified an association between a novel single nucleotide polymorphism in the CYP2C cluster on chromosome 10 (rs12777823) and warfarin dose requirement that reached genome-wide significance (p=1\u00b751\u00d710(-8)). This association was confirmed in the replication cohort (p=5\u00b704\u00d710(-5)); analysis of the two cohorts together produced a p value of 4\u00b75\u00d710(-12). Individuals heterozygous for the rs12777823 A allele need a dose reduction of 6\u00b792 mg/week and those homozygous 9\u00b734 mg/week. Regression analysis showed that the inclusion of rs12777823 significantly improves warfarin dose variability explained by the IWPC dosing algorithm (21% relative improvement). INTERPRETATION: A novel CYP2C single nucleotide polymorphism exerts a clinically relevant effect on warfarin dose in African Americans, independent of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. Incorporation of this variant into pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms could improve warfarin dose prediction in this population.

However, in the setting of rare variation, accumulating sufficient samples to assess these associations can be difficult. Moreover, multiple variations in a gene or a set of genes within a pathway may all contribute to the phenotype, suggesting that the aggregation of variations found over the gene or pathway may be useful for improving the power to detect associations.Here, we present a method for aggregating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) along biologically relevant pathways in order to seek genetic associations with phenotypes. Our method uses all available genetic variants and does not remove those in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Instead, it uses a novel SNP weighting scheme to down-weight the contributions of correlated SNPs. We apply our method to three cohorts of patients taking warfarin: two European descent cohorts and an African American cohort. Although the clinical covariates and key pharmacogenetic loci for warfarin have been characterized, our association metric identifies a significant association with mutations distributed throughout the pathway of warfarin metabolism. We improve dose prediction after using all known clinical covariates and pharmacogenetic variants in VKORC1 and CYP2C9. In particular, we find that at least 1% of the missing heritability in warfarin dose may be due to the aggregated effects of variations in the warfarin metabolic pathway, even though the SNPs do not individually show a significant association.Our method allows researchers to study aggregative SNP effects in an unbiased manner by not preselecting SNPs. It retains all the available information by accounting for LD-structure through weighting, which eliminates the need for LD pruning.

The latest version of dbSNP, for example, contains ~50 million validated Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs). SNVs make up most of human variation and are often the primary causes of disease. The non-synonymous SNVs (nsSNVs) result in single amino acid substitutions and may affect protein function, often causing disease. Although several methods for the detection of nsSNV effects have already been developed, the consistent increase in annotated data is offering the opportunity to improve prediction accuracy.Here we present a new approach for the detection of disease-associated nsSNVs (Meta-SNP) that integrates four existing methods: PANTHER, PhD-SNP, SIFT and SNAP. We first tested the accuracy of each method using a dataset of 35,766 disease-annotated mutations from 8,667 proteins extracted from the SwissVar database. The four methods reached overall accuracies of 64%-76% with a Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.38-0.53. We then used the outputs of these methods to develop a machine learning based approach that discriminates between disease-associated and polymorphic variants (Meta-SNP). In testing, the combined method reached 79% overall accuracy and 0.59 MCC, ~3% higher accuracy and ~0.05 higher correlation with respect to the best-performing method. Moreover, for the hardest-to-define subset of nsSNVs, i.e. variants for which half of the predictors disagreed with the other half, Meta-SNP attained 8% higher accuracy than the best predictor.Here we find that the Meta-SNP algorithm achieves better performance than the best single predictor. This result suggests that the methods used for the prediction of variant-disease associations are orthogonal, encoding different biologically relevant relationships. Careful combination of predictions from various resources is therefore a good strategy for the selection of high reliability predictions. Indeed, for the subset of nsSNVs where all predictors were in agreement (46% of all nsSNVs in the set), our method reached 87% overall accuracy and 0.73 MCC.

In this work, we present the web server implementation of SNPs&GO (WS-SNPs&GO). The server is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and for a given protein, its input comprises: the sequence and/or its three-dimensional structure (when available), a set of target variations and its functional Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The output of the server provides, for each protein variation, the probabilities to be associated to human diseases.The server consists of two main components, including updated versions of the sequence-based SNPs&GO (recently scored as one of the best algorithms for predicting deleterious SAPs) and of the structure-based SNPs&GO(3d) programs. Sequence and structure based algorithms are extensively tested on a large set of annotated variations extracted from the SwissVar database. Selecting a balanced dataset with more than 38,000 SAPs, the sequence-based approach achieves 81% overall accuracy, 0.61 correlation coefficient and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.88. For the subset of ~6,600 variations mapped on protein structures available at the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the structure-based method scores with 84% overall accuracy, 0.68 correlation coefficient, and 0.91 AUC. When tested on a new blind set of variations, the results of the server are 79% and 83% overall accuracy for the sequence-based and structure-based inputs, respectively.WS-SNPs&GO is a valuable tool that includes in a unique framework information derived from protein sequence, structure, evolutionary profile, and protein function. WS-SNPs&GO is freely available at http://snps.biofold.org/snps-and-go.

We hypothesized that Internet users may provide early clues about adverse drug events via their online information-seeking. We conducted a large-scale study of Web search log data gathered during 2010. We pay particular attention to the specific drug pairing of paroxetine and pravastatin, whose interaction was reported to cause hyperglycemia after the time period of the online logs used in the analysis. We also examine sets of drug pairs known to be associated with hyperglycemia and those not associated with hyperglycemia. We find that anonymized signals on drug interactions can be mined from search logs. Compared to analyses of other sources such as electronic health records (EHR), logs are inexpensive to collect and mine. The results demonstrate that logs of the search activities of populations of computer users can contribute to drug safety surveillance.

Recent estimates indicate that DDIs cause nearly 74000 emergency room visits and 195000 hospitalizations each year in the USA. Current approaches to DDI discovery, which include Phase IV clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, are insufficient for detecting many DDIs and do not alert the public to potentially dangerous DDIs before a drug enters the market. Recent work has applied state-of-the-art computational and statistical methods to the problem of DDIs. Here we review recent developments that encompass a range of informatics approaches in this domain, from the construction of databases for efficient searching of known DDIs to the prediction of novel DDIs based on data from electronic medical records, adverse event reports, scientific abstracts, and other sources. We also explore why DDIs are so difficult to detect and what the future holds for informatics-based approaches to DDI discovery.

Sentences are long and complex, the subject matter is highly specialized with a distinct vocabulary, and producing annotated training data for this domain is time consuming and expensive. In this environment, unsupervised text mining methods that do not rely on annotated training data are valuable. Here we investigate the use of random indexing, an automated method for producing vector-space semantic representations of words from large, unlabeled corpora, to address the problem of term normalization in sentences describing drugs and genes. We show that random indexing produces similarity scores that capture some of the structure of PHARE, a manually curated ontology of pharmacogenomics concepts. We further show that random indexing can be used to identify likely word candidates for inclusion in the ontology, and can help localize these new labels among classes and roles within the ontology.

Conventional order sets are top-down distributed by committees of experts, limited by the cost of manual development, maintenance, and limited end-user awareness. An alternative explored here applies statistical data-mining to physician order data (>330K order instances from >1.4K inpatient encounters) to extract clinical expertise from the bottom-up. This powers a corollary order suggestion engine using techniques analogous to commercial product recommendation systems (e.g., Amazon.com's \"Customers who bought this\u2026\" feature). Compared to a simple benchmark, the item-based association method illustrated here improves order prediction precision from 13% to 18% and further to 28% by incorporating information on the temporal relationship between orders. Incorporating statistics on conditional order frequency ratios further refines recommendations beyond just \"common\" orders to those relevant to a specific clinical context.

An additional aim was to explore the contribution of the CYP4F2 variant in comparison with, as well as after stratification for, the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 variants. Thirty studies involving 9,470 participants met prespecified inclusion criteria. As compared with CC-homozygotes, T-allele carriers required an 8.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.6-11.1%; P < 0.0001) higher mean daily coumarin dose than CC homozygotes to reach a stable international normalized ratio (INR). There was no evidence of publication bias. Heterogeneity among studies was present (I(2) = 43%). Our results show that the CYP4F2 p.V433M polymorphism is associated with interindividual variability in response to coumarin drugs, but with a low effect size that is confirmed to be lower than those contributed by VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms.

We previously showed that mice deficient in the \u03b22AR (\u03b22KO) had smaller infarcts compared with WT (wild-type) mice (FVB) after MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion), a model of stroke. To elucidate mechanisms of this neuroprotection, we evaluated changes in gene expression using microarrays comparing differences before and after MCAO, and differences between genotypes. Genes associated with inflammation and cell deaths were enriched after MCAO in both genotypes, and we identified several genes not previously shown to increase following ischaemia (Ccl9, Gem and Prg4). In addition to networks that were similar between genotypes, one network with a central core of GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) and including biological functions such as carbohydrate metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and inflammation was identified in FVB mice but not in \u03b22KO mice. Analysis of differences between genotypes revealed 11 genes differentially expressed by genotype both before and after ischaemia. We demonstrate greater Glo1 protein levels and lower Pmaip/Noxa mRNA levels in \u03b22KO mice in both sham and MCAO conditions. As both genes are implicated in NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor \u03baB) signalling, we measured p65 activity and TNF\u03b1 (tumour necrosis factor \u03b1) levels 24 h after MCAO. MCAO-induced p65 activation and post-ischaemic TNF\u03b1 production were both greater in FVB compared with \u03b22KO mice. These results suggest that loss of \u03b22AR signalling results in a neuroprotective phenotype in part due to decreased NF-\u03baB signalling, decreased inflammation and decreased apoptotic signalling in the brain.

Many therapeutic compounds are ineffective for a large subpopulation of patients to whom they are prescribed; worse, a significant fraction of patients experience adverse effects more severe than anticipated. The unacceptable risk-benefit profile for many drugs mandates a paradigm shift towards personalized medicine. However, prior to adoption of patient-specific approaches, it is useful to understand the molecular details underlying variable drug response among diverse patient populations. Over the past decade, progress in structural genomics led to an explosion of available three-dimensional structures of drug target proteins while efforts in pharmacogenetics offered insights into polymorphisms correlated with differential therapeutic outcomes. Together these advances provide the opportunity to examine how altered protein structures arising from genetic differences affect protein-drug interactions and, ultimately, drug response. In this review, we first summarize structural characteristics of protein targets and common mechanisms of drug interactions. Next, we describe the impact of coding mutations on protein structures and drug response. Finally, we highlight tools for analysing protein structures and protein-drug interactions and discuss their application for understanding altered drug responses associated with protein structural variants.

Here, we present an integrative personal omics profile (iPOP), an analysis that combines genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and autoantibody profiles from a single individual over a 14 month period. Our iPOP analysis revealed various medical risks, including type 2 diabetes. It also uncovered extensive, dynamic changes in diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and diseased conditions. Extremely high-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data, which provide the basis of our iPOP, revealed extensive heteroallelic changes during healthy and diseased states and an unexpected RNA editing mechanism. This study demonstrates that longitudinal iPOP can be used to interpret healthy and diseased states by connecting genomic information with additional dynamic omics activity.

Simulations can be used by biologists to study macromolecular assemblies and by clinicians to design treatments for diseases. Simulations help biomedical researchers understand the physical constraints on biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, synthetic tissues, medical devices, and surgical interventions. Although individual biomedical investigators make outstanding contributions to physics-based simulation, the field has been fragmented. Applications are typically limited to a single physical scale, and individual investigators usually must create their own software. These conditions created a major barrier to advancing simulation capabilities. In 2004, we established a National Center for Physics-Based Simulation of Biological Structures (Simbios) to help integrate the field and accelerate biomedical research. In 6 years, Simbios has become a vibrant national center, with collaborators in 16 states and eight countries. Simbios focuses on problems at both the molecular scale and the organismal level, with a long-term goal of uniting these in accurate multiscale simulations.

More than 100,000 individuals have been genotyped by direct-to-consumer genetic testing services, which offer a glimpse into the interpretation and exploration of a personal genome. However, these interpretations, which require extensive manual curation, are subject to the preferences of the company and are not customizable by the individual. Academic institutions teaching personalized medicine, as well as genetic hobbyists, may prefer to customize their analysis and have full control over the content and method of interpretation. We present the Interpretome, a system for private genome interpretation, which contains all genotype information in client-side interpretation scripts, supported by server-side databases. We provide state-of-the-art analyses for teaching clinical implications of personal genomics, including disease risk assessment and pharmacogenomics. Additionally, we have implemented client-side algorithms for ancestry inference, demonstrating the power of these methods without excessive computation. Finally, the modular nature of the system allows for plugin capabilities for custom analyses. This system will allow for personal genome exploration without compromising privacy, facilitating hands-on courses in genomics and personalized medicine.

Spontaneous reporting systems routinely collect ADEs from patients on complex combinations of medications and provide an opportunity to discover unexpected drug interactions. Unfortunately, current algorithms for such \"signal detection\" are limited by underreporting of interactions that are not expected. We present a novel method to identify latent drug interaction signals in the case of underreporting.We identified eight clinically significant adverse events. We used the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System to build profiles for these adverse events based on the side effects of drugs known to produce them. We then looked for pairs of drugs that match these single-drug profiles in order to predict potential interactions. We evaluated these interactions in two independent data sets and also through a retrospective analysis of the Stanford Hospital electronic medical records.We identified 171 novel drug interactions (for eight adverse event categories) that are significantly enriched for known drug interactions (p=0.0009) and used the electronic medical record for independently testing drug interaction hypotheses using multivariate statistical models with covariates.Our method provides an option for detecting hidden interactions in spontaneous reporting systems by using side effect profiles to infer the presence of unreported adverse events.

Most available information about gene-drug relationships is contained within the scientific literature, but is dispersed over a large number of publications, with thousands of new publications added each month. In this setting, automated text mining is an attractive solution for identifying gene-drug relationships and aggregating them to predict novel DDIs. In previous work, we have shown that gene-drug interactions can be extracted from Medline abstracts with high fidelity - we extract not only the genes and drugs, but also the type of relationship expressed in individual sentences (e.g. metabolize, inhibit, activate and many others). We normalize these relationships and map them to a standardized ontology. In this work, we hypothesize that we can combine these normalized gene-drug relationships, drawn from a very broad and diverse literature, to infer DDIs. Using a training set of established DDIs, we have trained a random forest classifier to score potential DDIs based on the features of the normalized assertions extracted from the literature that relate two drugs to a gene product. The classifier recognizes the combinations of relationships, drugs and genes that are most associated with the gold standard DDIs, correctly identifying 79.8% of assertions relating interacting drug pairs and 78.9% of assertions relating noninteracting drug pairs. Most significantly, because our text processing method captures the semantics of individual gene-drug relationships, we can construct mechanistic pharmacological explanations for the newly-proposed DDIs. We show how our classifier can be used to explain known DDIs and to uncover new DDIs that have not yet been reported.

Current methods focus on the geometry and detailed chemical interactions within putative binding pockets, but may not recognize distant similarities where dynamics or modified interactions allow one ligand to bind apparently divergent binding pockets. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that seeks similar microenvironments within two binding sites, and assesses overall binding site similarity by the presence of multiple shared microenvironments. The method has relatively weak geometric requirements (to allow for conformational change or dynamics in both the ligand and the pocket) and uses multiple biophysical and biochemical measures to characterize the microenvironments (to allow for diverse modes of ligand binding). We term the algorithm PocketFEATURE, since it focuses on pockets using the FEATURE system for characterizing microenvironments. We validate PocketFEATURE first by showing that it can better discriminate sites that bind similar ligands from those that do not, and by showing that we can recognize FAD-binding sites on a proteome scale with Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 92%. We then apply PocketFEATURE to evolutionarily distant kinases, for which the method recognizes several proven distant relationships, and predicts unexpected shared ligand binding. Using experimental data from ChEMBL and Ambit, we show that at high significance level, 40 kinase pairs are predicted to share ligands. Some of these pairs offer new opportunities for inhibiting two proteins in a single pathway.

Here, we develop a novel synthetic human reference sequence that is ethnically concordant and use it for the analysis of genomes from a nuclear family with history of familial thrombophilia. We demonstrate that the use of the major allele reference sequence results in improved genotype accuracy for disease-associated variant loci. We infer recombination sites to the lowest median resolution demonstrated to date (< 1,000 base pairs). We use family inheritance state analysis to control sequencing error and inform family-wide haplotype phasing, allowing quantification of genome-wide compound heterozygosity. We develop a sequence-based methodology for Human Leukocyte Antigen typing that contributes to disease risk prediction. Finally, we advance methods for analysis of disease and pharmacogenomic risk across the coding and non-coding genome that incorporate phased variant data. We show these methods are capable of identifying multigenic risk for inherited thrombophilia and informing the appropriate pharmacological therapy. These ethnicity-specific, family-based approaches to interpretation of genetic variation are emblematic of the next generation of genetic risk assessment using whole-genome sequencing.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are expensive because they model every atom independently, and are difficult to combine with experimentally derived knowledge. Assembly of molecules using fragments from libraries relies on the database of known structures and thus may not work for novel motifs. Coarse-grained modeling methods have yielded good results on large molecules but can suffer from difficulties in creating more detailed full atomic realizations. There is therefore a need for molecular modeling algorithms that remain chemically accurate and economical for large molecules, do not rely on fragment libraries, and can incorporate experimental information. RNABuilder works in the internal coordinate space of dihedral angles and thus has time requirements proportional to the number of moving parts rather than the number of atoms. It provides accurate physics-based response to applied forces, but also allows user-specified forces for incorporating experimental information. A particular strength of RNABuilder is that all Leontis-Westhof basepairs can be specified as primitives by the user to be satisfied during model construction. We apply RNABuilder to predict the structure of an RNA molecule with 160 bases from its secondary structure, as well as experimental information. Our model matches the known structure to 10.2 Angstroms RMSD and has low computational expense.

We developed the ALPHABIT (a large-scale process to hunt for allele binding interacting transcription factors) pipeline, which includes statistical analysis of binding sites followed by experimental validation, and demonstrate that this method predicts transcription factors that associate with NF\u03baB.

To understand how homologous RNA molecules with different global architectures fold into a common core structure we determined, under identical conditions, the folding mechanisms of three phylogenetically divergent group I intron ribozymes. These ribozymes share a conserved functional core defined by topologically equivalent tertiary motifs but differ in their primary sequence, size, and structural complexity. Time-resolved hydroxyl radical probing of the backbone solvent accessible surface and catalytic activity measurements integrated with structural-kinetic modeling reveal that each ribozyme adopts a unique strategy to attain the conserved functional fold. The folding rates are not dictated by the size or the overall structural complexity, but rather by the strength of the constituent tertiary motifs which, in turn, govern the structure, stability, and lifetime of the folding intermediates. A fundamental general principle of RNA folding emerges from this study: The dominant folding flux always proceeds through an optimally structured kinetic intermediate that has sufficient stability to act as a nucleating scaffold while retaining enough conformational freedom to avoid kinetic trapping. Our results also suggest a potential role of naturally selected peripheral A-minor interactions in balancing RNA structural stability with folding efficiency.

Non-synonymous SNPs occurring in coding regions result in single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) that may affect protein function and lead to pathology. Several methods attempt to estimate the impact of SAPs using different sources of information. Although sequence-based predictors have shown good performance, the quality of these predictions can be further improved by introducing new features derived from three-dimensional protein structures.In this paper, we present a structure-based machine learning approach for predicting disease-related SAPs. We have trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a set of 3,342 disease-related mutations and 1,644 neutral polymorphisms from 784 protein chains. We use SVM input features derived from the protein's sequence, structure, and function. After dataset balancing, the structure-based method (SVM-3D) reaches an overall accuracy of 85%, a correlation coefficient of 0.70, and an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. When compared with a similar sequence-based predictor, SVM-3D results in an increase of the overall accuracy and AUC by 3%, and correlation coefficient by 0.06. The robustness of this improvement has been tested on different datasets and in all the cases SVM-3D performs better than previously developed methods even when compared with PolyPhen2, which explicitly considers in input protein structure information.This work demonstrates that structural information can increase the accuracy of disease-related SAPs identification. Our results also quantify the magnitude of improvement on a large dataset. This improvement is in agreement with previously observed results, where structure information enhanced the prediction of protein stability changes upon mutation. Although the structural information contained in the Protein Data Bank is limiting the application and the performance of our structure-based method, we expect that SVM-3D will result in higher accuracy when more structural date become available.

Unexpected interactions between them could have important public health implications. We mined the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) for side-effect profiles involving glucose homeostasis and found a surprisingly strong signal for comedication with pravastatin and paroxetine. We retrospectively evaluated changes in blood glucose in 104 patients with diabetes and 135 without diabetes who had received comedication with these two drugs, using data in electronic medical record (EMR) systems of three geographically distinct sites. We assessed the mean random blood glucose levels before and after treatment with the drugs. We found that pravastatin and paroxetine, when administered together, had a synergistic effect on blood glucose. The average increase was 19 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/l) overall, and in those with diabetes it was 48 mg/dl (2.7 mmol/l). In contrast, neither drug administered singly was associated with such changes in glucose levels. An increase in glucose levels is not a general effect of combined therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and statins.

The primary outcome of the pharmacogenomic field is the identification of biomarkers that can predict drug toxicity and drug response, thereby individualizing and improving drug treatment of patients. The drug in question and the polymorphic gene exerting the impact are the main issues to be searched for in the databases. Here, we review the databases that provide useful information in this respect, of benefit for the development of the pharmacogenomic field.

Not only are thioredoxins linked to a variety of disorders, but their stable structure has also seen application in protein engineering. Both sequence-based and structure-based tools exist for thioredoxin identification, but remote homolog detection remains a challenge. We developed a thioredoxin predictor using the approach of integrating sequence with structural information. We combined a sequence-based Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a molecular dynamics enhanced structure-based recognition method (dynamic FEATURE, DF). This hybrid method (HMMDF) has high precision and recall (0.90 and 0.95, respectively) compared with HMM (0.92 and 0.87, respectively) and DF (0.82 and 0.97, respectively). Dynamic FEATURE is sensitive but struggles to resolve closely related protein families, while HMM identifies these evolutionary differences by compromising sensitivity. Our method applied to structural genomics targets makes a strong prediction of a novel thioredoxin.

This conclusion rests on the recognition that PGx has greatly mitigated risks as compared with using genomics for assessment of disease risk. Failure to recognize these differences can produce unrealistic cost-benefit scenarios and impractical standards of evidence. In many cases, pharmacogenetic tests need only reach reasonable expectations of noninferiority (compared with current prescribing practices) to merit use.

R(F) and the R(1) to R(F) transition are currently the subject of intense research, driven in part by the potential for developing novel antibiotics which trap R(F) or confound the R(1) to R(F) transition. Currently lacking a 3D atomic structure of the R(F) endpoint of the transition, as well as a preliminary conformational trajectory connecting R(1) and R(F), the dynamics of the mechanistically crucial R(1) to R(F) transition remain elusive. The current literature reports fitting of only a few ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal protein (r-protein) components into cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions of the Escherichia coli ribosome in RF. In this work we now fit the entire Thermus thermophilus 16S and 23S rRNAs and most of the remaining T. thermophilus r-proteins into a cryo-EM reconstruction of the E. coli ribosome in R(F) in order to build an almost complete model of the T. thermophilus ribosome in R(F) thus allowing a more detailed view of this crucial conformation. The resulting model validates key predictions from the published literature; in particular it recovers intersubunit bridges known to be maintained throughout the R(1) to R(F) transition and results in new intersubunit bridges that are predicted to exist only in R(F). In addition, we use a recently reported E. coli ribosome structure, apparently trapped in an intermediate state along the R(1) to R(F) transition pathway, referred to here as R(2), as a guide to generate a T. thermophilus ribosome in the R(2) state. This demonstrates a multiresolution method for morphing large complexes and provides us with a structural model of R(2) in the species of interest. The generated structural models form the basis for probing the motion of the deacylated tRNA bound at the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site) of the pre-translocation ribosome as it moves from its so-called classical P/P configuration to its so-called hybrid P/E configuration as part of the R(1) to R(F) transition. We create a dynamic model of this process which provides structural insights into the functional significance of R(2) as well as detailed atomic information to guide the design of further experiments. The results suggest extensibility to other steps of protein synthesis as well as to spatially larger systems.

The variability and the complexity of natural language in expressing similar relationships causes the extracted relationships to be highly heterogeneous, which makes the construction of knowledge bases difficult and poses a challenge in using these for data mining or question answering.We report on the semi-automatic construction of the PHARE relationship ontology (the PHArmacogenomic RElationships Ontology) consisting of 200 curated relations from over 40,000 heterogeneous relationships extracted via text-mining. These heterogeneous relations are then mapped to the PHARE ontology using synonyms, entity descriptions and hierarchies of entities and roles. Once mapped, relationships can be normalized and compared using the structure of the ontology to identify relationships that have similar semantics but different syntax. We compare and contrast the manual procedure with a fully automated approach using WordNet to quantify the degree of integration enabled by iterative curation and refinement of the PHARE ontology. The result of such integration is a repository of normalized biomedical relationships, named PHARE-KB, which can be queried using Semantic Web technologies such as SPARQL and can be visualized in the form of a biological network.The PHARE ontology serves as a common semantic framework to integrate more than 40,000 relationships pertinent to pharmacogenomics. The PHARE ontology forms the foundation of a knowledge base named PHARE-KB. Once populated with relationships, PHARE-KB (i) can be visualized in the form of a biological network to guide human tasks such as database curation and (ii) can be queried programmatically to guide bioinformatics applications such as the prediction of molecular interactions. PHARE is available at http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PHARE.

Methods that query these repositories based on gene expression content, rather than textual annotations, may enable more effective experiment retrieval as well as the discovery of novel associations between drugs, diseases, and other perturbations.We develop methods to retrieve gene expression experiments that differentially express the same transcriptional programs as a query experiment. Avoiding thresholds, we generate differential expression profiles that include a score for each gene measured in an experiment. We use existing and novel dimension reduction and correlation measures to rank relevant experiments in an entirely data-driven manner, allowing emergent features of the data to drive the results. A combination of matrix decomposition and p-weighted Pearson correlation proves the most suitable for comparing differential expression profiles. We apply this method to index all GEO DataSets, and demonstrate the utility of our approach by identifying pathways and conditions relevant to transcription factors Nanog and FoxO3.Content-based gene expression search generates relevant hypotheses for biological inquiry. Experiments across platforms, tissue types, and protocols inform the analysis of new datasets.

This presents a unique opportunity for intelligent data mining methods to extract information about the transcriptional modules underlying these biological processes. Modeling cellular gene expression as a combination of functional modules, we use independent component analysis (ICA) to derive 423 fundamental components of human biology from a 9395-array compendium of heterogeneous expression data. Annotation using the Gene Ontology (GO) suggests that while some of these components represent known biological modules, others may describe biology not well characterized by existing manually-curated ontologies. In order to understand the biological functions represented by these modules, we investigate the mechanism of the preclinical anti-cancer drug parthenolide (PTL) by analyzing the differential expression of our fundamental components. Our method correctly identifies known pathways and predicts that N-glycan biosynthesis and T-cell receptor signaling may contribute to PTL response. The fundamental gene modules we describe have the potential to provide pathway-level insight into new gene expression datasets.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for extracting relationships in specific domains often rely on hand-built rules and domain-specific ontologies to achieve good performance. In a new and evolving field such as pharmacogenomics (PGx), rules and ontologies may not be available. Recent progress in syntactic NLP parsing in the context of a large corpus of pharmacogenomics text provides new opportunities for automated relationship extraction. We describe an ontology of PGx relationships built starting from a lexicon of key pharmacogenomic entities and a syntactic parse of more than 87 million sentences from 17 million MEDLINE abstracts. We used the syntactic structure of PGx statements to systematically extract commonly occurring relationships and to map them to a common schema. Our extracted relationships have a 70-87.7% precision and involve not only key PGx entities such as genes, drugs, and phenotypes (e.g., VKORC1, warfarin, clotting disorder), but also critical entities that are frequently modified by these key entities (e.g., VKORC1 polymorphism, warfarin response, clotting disorder treatment). The result of our analysis is a network of 40,000 relationships between more than 200 entity types with clear semantics. This network is used to guide the curation of PGx knowledge and provide a computable resource for knowledge discovery.

Pharmacogenomics GWAS attempt to elucidate genotypes predictive of drug response. However, the size of these studies has severely limited their power and potential application. We propose a novel knowledge integration and SNP aggregation approach for identifying genes impacting drug response. Our SNP aggregation method characterizes the degree to which uncommon alleles of a gene are associated with drug response. We first use pre-existing knowledge sources to rank pharmacogenes by their likelihood to affect drug response. We then define a summary score for each gene based on allele frequencies and train linear and logistic regression classifiers to predict drug response phenotypes.We applied our method to a published warfarin GWAS data set comprising 181 individuals. We find that our method can increase the power of the GWAS to identify both VKORC1 and CYP2C9 as warfarin pharmacogenes, where the original analysis had only identified VKORC1. Additionally, we find that our method can be used to discriminate between low-dose (AUROC=0.886) and high-dose (AUROC=0.764) responders.Our method offers a new route for candidate pharmacogene discovery from pharmacogenomics GWAS, and serves as a foundation for future work in methods for predictive pharmacogenomics.

Using a clinical warfarin dosing algorithm derived from research-quality data, we evaluated the data quality of both a general-purpose database and a coagulation-specific database. We evaluated the functional utility of these repositories by using data extracted from them to predict warfarin dose. We reasoned that high-quality clinical data would predict doses nearly as accurately as research data, while poor-quality clinical data would predict doses less accurately. We evaluated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in predicted weekly dose as a metric of data quality. The MAE was comparable between the clinical gold standard (10.1mg/wk) and the specialty database (10.4 mg/wk), but the MAE for the clinical warehouse was 40% greater (14.1mg/wk). Our results indicate that the research utility of clinical data collected in focused clinical settings is greater than that of data collected during general-purpose clinical care.

In order to integrate our knowledge, connect important facts across publications and generate new hypotheses we must organize and encode the contents of the literature. By creating databases of structured pharmocogenomic knowledge, we can make the value of the literature much greater than the sum of the individual reports. We can, for example, generate candidate gene lists or interpret surprising hits in genome-wide association studies. Text mining automatically adds structure to the unstructured knowledge embedded in millions of publications, and recent years have seen a surge in work on biomedical text mining, some specific to pharmacogenomics literature. These methods enable extraction of specific types of information and can also provide answers to general, systemic queries. In this article, we describe the main tasks of text mining in the context of pharmacogenomics, summarize recent applications and anticipate the next phase of text mining applications.

As for proteins, the detailed three-dimensional (3D) structure of RNA is often key to understanding its function. Although crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can determine the atomic coordinates of some RNA structures, many 3D structures present technical challenges that make these methods difficult to apply. The great flexibility of RNA, its charged backbone, dearth of specific surface features, and propensity for kinetic traps all conspire with its long folding time, to challenge in silico methods for physics-based folding. On the other hand, base-pairing interactions (either in runs to form helices or isolated tertiary contacts) and motifs are often available from relatively low-cost experiments or informatics analyses. We present RNABuilder, a novel code that uses internal coordinate mechanics to satisfy user-specified base pairing and steric forces under chemical constraints. The code recapitulates the topology and characteristic L-shape of tRNA and obtains an accurate noncrystallographic structure of the Tetrahymena ribozyme P4/P6 domain. The algorithm scales nearly linearly with molecule size, opening the door to the modeling of significantly larger structures.

We sought to analyze new factors involved in its dosing and to evaluate eight dosing algorithms, including two developed by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC).we enrolled 108 patients on chronic warfarin therapy and obtained complete clinical and pharmacy records; we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms relevant to the VKORC1, CYP2C9, and CYP4F2 genes using integrated fluidic circuits made by Fluidigm.When applying the IWPC pharmacogenetic algorithm to our cohort of patients, the percentage of patients within 1 mg/d of the therapeutic warfarin dose increases from 54% to 63% using clinical factors only, or from 38% using a fixed-dose approach. CYP4F2 adds 4% to the fraction of the variability in dose (R) explained by the IWPC pharmacogenetic algorithm (P<0.05). Importantly, we show that pooling rare variants substantially increases the R for CYP2C9 (rare variants: P=0.0065, R=6%; common variants: P=0.0034, R=7%; rare and common variants: P=0.00018; R=12%), indicating that relatively rare variants not genotyped in genome-wide association studies may be important. In addition, the IWPC pharmacogenetic algorithm and the Gage (2008) algorithm perform best (IWPC: R=50%; Gage: R=49%), and all pharmacogenetic algorithms outperform the IWPC clinical equation (R=22%). VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes did not affect long-term variability in dose. Finally, the Fluidigm platform, a novel warfarin genotyping method, showed 99.65% concordance between different operators and instruments.CYP4F2 and pooled rare variants of CYP2C9 significantly improve the ability to estimate warfarin dose.

However, these algorithms better capture dose variability among whites than Asians or blacks. Herein, we evaluate whether other VKORC1 polymorphisms and haplotypes explain additional variation in warfarin dose beyond that explained by VKORC1 -1639G>A among Asians (n = 1103), blacks (n = 670), and whites (n = 3113). Participants were recruited from 11 countries as part of the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium effort. Evaluation of the effects of individual VKORC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes on warfarin dose used both univariate and multi variable linear regression. VKORC1 -1639G>A and 1173C>T individually explained the greatest variance in dose in all 3 racial groups. Incorporation of additional VKORC1 SNPs or haplotypes did not further improve dose prediction. VKORC1 explained greater variability in dose among whites than blacks and Asians. Differences in the percentage of variance in dose explained by VKORC1 across race were largely accounted for by the frequency of the -1639A (or 1173T) allele. Thus, clinicians should recognize that, although at a population level, the contribution of VKORC1 toward dose requirements is higher in whites than in nonwhites; genotype predicts similar dose requirements across racial groups.

The primary mission was to create a repository of primary data, tools to track associations between genes and drugs, and to catalog the location and frequency of genetic variations known to impact drug response. Over the past 10 years, new technologies have shifted research from candidate gene pharmacogenetics to phenotype-based pharmacogenomics with a consequent explosion of data. PharmGKB has refocused on curating knowledge rather than housing primary genotype and phenotype data, and now, captures more complex relationships between genes, variants, drugs, diseases and pathways. Going forward, the challenges are to provide the tools and knowledge to plan and interpret genome-wide pharmacogenomics studies, predict gene-drug relationships based on shared mechanisms and support data-sharing consortia investigating clinical applications of pharmacogenomics.

A common strategy for mitigating the effects of noise is to perform many experimental replicates. This approach is often costly and sometimes impossible given limited resources; thus, analytical methods are needed which increase accuracy at no additional cost. One inexpensive source of microarray replicates comes from prior work: to date, data from hundreds of thousands of microarray experiments are in the public domain. Although these data assay a wide range of conditions, they cannot be used directly to inform any particular experiment and are thus ignored by most DE gene methods. We present the SVD Augmented Gene expression Analysis Tool (SAGAT), a mathematically principled, data-driven approach for identifying DE genes. SAGAT increases the power of a microarray experiment by using observed coexpression relationships from publicly available microarray datasets to reduce uncertainty in individual genes' expression measurements. We tested the method on three well-replicated human microarray datasets and demonstrate that use of SAGAT increased effective sample sizes by as many as 2.72 arrays. We applied SAGAT to unpublished data from a microarray study investigating transcriptional responses to insulin resistance, resulting in a 50% increase in the number of significant genes detected. We evaluated 11 (58%) of these genes experimentally using qPCR, confirming the directions of expression change for all 11 and statistical significance for three. Use of SAGAT revealed coherent biological changes in three pathways: inflammation, differentiation, and fatty acid synthesis, furthering our molecular understanding of a type 2 diabetes risk factor. We envision SAGAT as a means to maximize the potential for biological discovery from subtle transcriptional responses, and we provide it as a freely available software package that is immediately applicable to any human microarray study.

Unfortunately, our ability to analyze these proteins is restricted by the limited catalog of known molecular functions and their associated 3D motifs.In order to identify novel 3D motifs that may be associated with molecular functions, we employ an unsupervised, two-phase clustering approach that combines k-means and hierarchical clustering with knowledge-informed cluster selection and annotation methods. We applied the approach to approximately 20,000 cysteine-based protein microenvironments (3D regions 7.5 A in radius) and identified 70 interesting clusters, some of which represent known motifs (e.g. metal binding and phosphatase activity), and some of which are novel, including several zinc binding sites. Detailed annotation results are available online for all 70 clusters at http://feature.stanford.edu/clustering/cys.The use of microenvironments instead of backbone geometric criteria enables flexible exploration of protein function space, and detection of recurring motifs that are discontinuous in sequence and diverse in structure. Clustering microenvironments may thus help to functionally characterize novel proteins and better understand the protein structure-function relationship.

The aim of the Genotype-Phenotype-Drug Relationship Extraction from Text workshop (or GPD-Rx workshop) is to examine the current state of art and discuss the next steps for making the extraction of relationships between biomedical entities integral to the curation and knowledge management workflow in Pharmacogenomics. The workshop will focus particularly on the extraction of Genotype-Phenotype, Genotype-Drug, and Phenotype-Drug relationships that are of interest to Pharmacogenomics. Extracting and structuring such text-mined relationships is a key to support the evaluation and the validation of multiple hypotheses that emerge from high throughput translational studies spanning multiple measurement modalities. In order to advance this agenda, it is essential that existing relationship extraction methods be compared to one another and that a community wide benchmark corpus emerges; against which future methods can be compared. The workshop aims to bring together researchers working on the automatic or semi-automatic extraction of relationships between biomedical entities from research literature in order to identify the key groups interested in creating such a benchmark.

However, certain structural information such as base pairing and some tertiary contacts can be determined readily for many RNAs by bioinformatics or relatively low cost experiments. Further, because RNA structure is highly modular, it is possible to deduce local 3D structure from the solved structures of evolutionarily related RNAs or even unrelated RNAs that share the same module. RNABuilder is a software package that generates model RNA structures by treating the kinematics and forces at separate, multiple levels of resolution. Kinematically, bonds in bases, certain stretches of residues, and some entire molecules are rigid while other bonds remain flexible. Forces act on the rigid bases and selected individual atoms. Here we use RNABuilder to predict the structure of the 200-nucleotide Azoarcus group I intron by homology modeling against fragments of the distantly-related Twort and Tetrahymena group I introns and by incorporating base pairing forces where necessary. In the absence of any information from the solved Azoarcus intron crystal structure, the model accurately depicts the global topology, secondary and tertiary connections, and gives an overall RMSD value of 4.6 A relative to the crystal structure. The accuracy of the model is even higher in the intron core (RMSD = 3.5 A), whereas deviations are modestly larger for peripheral regions that differ more substantially between the different introns. These results lay the groundwork for using this approach for larger and more diverse group I introns, as well for still larger RNAs and RNA-protein complexes such as group II introns and the ribosomal subunits.

We have previously reported a method that creates a genome-scale ranking of genes likely to interact with a drug. The algorithm uses information about drug structure and indications of use to rank the genes. Although the algorithm has good performance, its performance depends on a curated set of drug-gene relationships that is expensive to create and difficult to maintain. In this work, we assess the utility of text mining in extracting a network of drug-gene relationships automatically. This provides a valuable aggregate source of knowledge, subsequently used as input into the algorithm that ranks potential pharmacogenes. Using a drug-gene network created from sentence-level co-occurrence in the full text of scientific articles, we compared the performance to that of a network created by manual curation of those articles. Under a wide range of conditions, we show that a knowledge base derived from text-mining the literature performs as well as, and sometimes better than, a high-quality, manually curated knowledge base. We conclude that we can use relationships mined automatically from the literature as a knowledgebase for pharmacogenomics relationships. Additionally, when relationships are missed by text mining, our system can accurately extrapolate new relationships with 77.4% precision. View details for PubMedID 19908383 The recent development of methods for modeling RNA 3D structures using coarse-grain approaches creates a need to bridge low- and high-resolution modeling methods. Although they contain topological information, coarse-grain models lack atomic detail, which limits their utility for some applications.We have developed a method for adding full atomic detail to coarse-grain models of RNA 3D structures. Our method [Coarse to Atomic (C2A)] uses geometries observed in known RNA crystal structures. Our method rebuilds full atomic detail from ideal coarse-grain backbones taken from crystal structures to within 1.87-3.31 A RMSD of the full atomic crystal structure. When starting from coarse-grain models generated by the modeling tool NAST, our method builds full atomic structures that are within 1.00 A RMSD of the starting structure. The resulting full atomic structures can be used as starting points for higher resolution modeling, thus bridging high- and low-resolution approaches to modeling RNA 3D structure.Code for the C2A method, as well as the examples discussed in this article, are freely available at www.simtk.org/home/c2a.russ.altman@stanford.edu View details for DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp576 View details for Web of Science ID 000272464000008 View details for PubMedID 19812110 View details for PubMedCentralID PMC2788923 Protein ligand-binding sites in the apo state exhibit structural flexibility. This flexibility often frustrates methods for structure-based recognition of these sites because it leads to the absence of electron density for these critical regions, particularly when they are in surface loops. Methods for recognizing functional sites in these missing loops would be useful for recovering additional functional information.We report a hybrid approach for recognizing calcium-binding sites in disordered regions. Our approach combines loop modeling with a machine learning method (FEATURE) for structure-based site recognition. For validation, we compared the performance of our method on known calcium-binding sites for which there are both holo and apo structures. When loops in the apo structures are rebuilt using modeling methods, FEATURE identifies 14 out of 20 crystallographically proven calcium-binding sites. It only recognizes 7 out of 20 calcium-binding sites in the initial apo crystal structures.We applied our method to unstructured loops in proteins from SCOP families known to bind calcium in order to discover potential cryptic calcium binding sites. We built 2745 missing loops and evaluated them for potential calcium binding. We made 102 predictions of calcium-binding sites. Ten predictions are consistent with independent experimental verifications. We found indirect experimental evidence for 14 other predictions. The remaining 78 predictions are novel predictions, some with intriguing potential biological significance. In particular, we see an enrichment of beta-sheet folds with predicted calcium binding sites in the connecting loops on the surface that may be important for calcium-mediated function switches.Protein crystal structures are a potentially rich source of functional information. When loops are missing in these structures, we may be losing important information about binding sites and active sites. We have shown that limited loop modeling (e.g. loops less than 17 residues) combined with pattern matching algorithms can recover functions and propose putative conformations associated with these functions.

High-throughput experimental methods are often plagued by false positives and do not take advantage of existing knowledge. Candidate gene lists can usefully summarize existing knowledge, but they are expensive to generate manually and may therefore have incomplete coverage. We have developed a method that ranks 12,460 genes in the human genome on the basis of their potential relevance to a specific query drug and its putative indications. Our method uses known gene-drug interactions, networks of gene-gene interactions, and available measures of drug-drug similarity. It ranks genes by building a local network of known interactions and assessing the similarity of the query drug (by both structure and indication) with drugs that interact with gene products in the local network. In a comprehensive benchmark, our method achieves an overall area under the curve of 0.82. To showcase our method, we found novel gene candidates for warfarin, gefitinib, carboplatin, and gemcitabine, and we provide the molecular hypotheses for these predictions.

Subjects with chronic knee OA were randomized to 3 weekly intra-articular (IA) injections of either buffered saline (IA-SA) or IA-BioHA (20 mg/2 ml). The primary efficacy outcome was subject recorded difference in least-squares means between IA-BioHA and IA-SA in subjects' change from baseline to week 26 following a 50-foot walk test, measured via 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures included Osteoarthritis Research Society International responder index, Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index VA 3.1 subscales, patient global assessment, rescue medication, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by the SF-36. Safety was assessed by monitoring and reporting vital signs, physical examination of the target knee following injection, adverse events, and concomitant medications.Five hundred eighty-eight subjects were randomized to either IA-BioHA (n = 293) or IA-SA (n = 295), with an 88% 26 week completion rate. No statistical differences were noted between the treatment groups at baseline. In the IA-BioHA group, mean VAS scores decreased by 25.7 mm, compared with 18.5 mm in the IA-SA group. This corresponded to a median reduction of 53% from baseline for IA-BioHA and a 38% reduction for IA-SA. The difference in least-squares means was -6.6 mm (P = 0.002). Secondary outcome measures were consistent with significant improvement in Osteoarthritis Research Society International responder index, HRQoL, and function. Both IA-SA and IA-BioHA injections were well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events that were equally distributed between groups. Injection-site reactions were reported by 1 (<1%) subject in the IA-SA group and 2 (1%) in the IA-BioHA group.IA-BioHA therapy resulted in significant OA knee pain relief at 26 weeks compared with IA-SA. Subjects treated with IA-BioHA also experienced significant improvements in joint function, treatment satisfaction, and HRQoL.

Particularly problematic are novel folds with little detectable similarity to molecules of known function. Experimental assays can determine the functions of such molecules, but are time-consuming and expensive. Computational approaches can identify potential functional sites; however, these approaches generally rely on single static structures and do not use information about dynamics. In fact, structural dynamics can enhance function prediction: we coupled molecular dynamics simulations with structure-based function prediction algorithms that identify Ca(2+) binding sites. When applied to 11 challenging proteins, both methods showed substantial improvement in performance, revealing 22 more sites in one case and 12 more in the other, with a modest increase in apparent false positives. Thus, we show that treating molecules as dynamic entities improves the performance of structure-based function prediction methods.

The field is rapidly gaining importance: it promises drugs targeted to particular subpopulations based on genetic background. The pharmacogenomics literature has expanded rapidly, but is dispersed in many journals. It is challenging, therefore, to identify important associations between drugs and molecular entities--particularly genes and gene variants, and thus these critical connections are often lost. Text mining techniques can allow us to convert the free-style text to a computable, searchable format in which pharmacogenomic concepts (such as genes, drugs, polymorphisms, and diseases) are identified, and important links between these concepts are recorded. Availability of full text articles as input into text mining engines is key, as literature abstracts often do not contain sufficient information to identify these pharmacogenomic associations.Thus, building on a tool called Textpresso, we have created the Pharmspresso tool to assist in identifying important pharmacogenomic facts in full text articles. Pharmspresso parses text to find references to human genes, polymorphisms, drugs and diseases and their relationships. It presents these as a series of marked-up text fragments, in which key concepts are visually highlighted. To evaluate Pharmspresso, we used a gold standard of 45 human-curated articles. Pharmspresso identified 78%, 61%, and 74% of target gene, polymorphism, and drug concepts, respectively.Pharmspresso is a text analysis tool that extracts pharmacogenomic concepts from the literature automatically and thus captures our current understanding of gene-drug interactions in a computable form.

However, creating three-dimensional (3D) structural models of RNA remains a significant challenge. We present a protocol (the nucleic acid simulation tool [NAST]) for RNA modeling that uses an RNA-specific knowledge-based potential in a coarse-grained molecular dynamics engine to generate plausible 3D structures. We demonstrate NAST's capabilities by using only secondary structure and tertiary contact predictions to generate, cluster, and rank structures. Representative structures in the best ranking clusters averaged 8.0 +/- 0.3 A and 16.3 +/- 1.0 A RMSD for the yeast phenylalanine tRNA and the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, respectively. The coarse-grained resolution allows us to model large molecules such as the 158-residue P4-P6 or the 388-residue T. thermophila group I intron. One advantage of NAST is the ability to rank clusters of structurally similar decoys based on their compatibility with experimental data. We successfully used ideal small-angle X-ray scattering data and both ideal and experimental solvent accessibility data to select the best cluster of structures for both tRNA and P4-P6. Finally, we used NAST to build in missing loops in the crystal structures of the Azoarcus and Twort ribozymes, and to incorporate crystallographic data into the Michel-Westhof model of the T. thermophila group I intron, creating an integrated model of the entire molecule.

To date, using reductionist techniques, immunologists have elucidated many of the basic principles of how the immune system functions, yet our understanding is still far from complete. In an era of high throughput measurements, it is already clear that the scientific knowledge we have accumulated has itself grown larger than our ability to cope with it, and thus it is increasingly important to develop bioinformatics tools with which to navigate the complexity of the information that is available to us. Here, we describe ImmuneXpresso, an information extraction system, tailored for parsing the primary literature of immunology and relating it to experimental data. The immune system is very much dependent on the interactions of various white blood cells with each other, either in synaptic contacts, at a distance using cytokines or chemokines, or both. Therefore, as a first approximation, we used ImmuneXpresso to create a literature derived network of interactions between cells and cytokines. Integration of cell-specific gene expression data facilitates cross-validation of cytokine mediated cell-cell interactions and suggests novel interactions. We evaluate the performance of our automatically generated multi-scale model against existing manually curated data, and show how this system can be used to guide experimentalists in interpreting multi-scale, experimental data. Our methodology is scalable and can be generalized to other systems.

Methods for the statistical assessment of optimum dosing are lacking. We developed a generic framework for dose titration and demonstrated its application in two domains. Optimum warfarin dose was estimated from clinical titration data. In addition, cardiac pacemaker interval optimization was conducted using three conventional techniques. For both data types, optima were obtained from mathematical functions fit to the raw data. The precision of the estimated optima was quantified using bootstrapping. In pacing optimization, the observed precision varied significantly among the techniques, suggesting that impedance cardiography is superior to commonly used echocardiographic methods. The average 95% confidence interval of the estimated optimum warfarin dose was +/-18%, suggesting that titration within this range is of limited utility. By identifying statistically ineffective interventions, objective analysis of optimization data may both improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. View details for PubMedID 20351936 Several applications in biology - e.g., incorporation of protein flexibility in ligand docking algorithms, interpretation of fuzzy X-ray crystallographic data, and homology modeling - require computing the internal parameters of a flexible fragment (usually, a loop) of a protein in order to connect its termini to the rest of the protein without causing any steric clash. One must often sample many such conformations in order to explore and adequately represent the conformational range of the studied loop. While sampling must be fast, it is made difficult by the fact that two conflicting constraints - kinematic closure and clash avoidance - must be satisfied concurrently. This paper describes two efficient and complementary sampling algorithms to explore the space of closed clash-free conformations of a flexible protein loop. The \"seed sampling\" algorithm samples broadly from this space, while the \"deformation sampling\" algorithm uses seed conformations as starting points to explore the conformation space around them at a finer grain. Computational results are presented for various loops ranging from 5 to 25 residues. More specific results also show that the combination of the sampling algorithms with a functional site prediction software (FEATURE) makes it possible to compute and recognize calcium-binding loop conformations. The sampling algorithms are implemented in a toolkit (LoopTK), which is available at https://simtk.org/home/looptk.

There is an explosion in algorithms and tools for computational biology, which makes it difficult for biologists to find, compare and integrate such resources. We describe a new infrastructure, iTools, for managing the query, traversal and comparison of diverse computational biology resources. Specifically, iTools stores information about three types of resources--data, software tools and web-services. The iTools design, implementation and resource meta-data content reflect the broad research, computational, applied and scientific expertise available at the seven National Centers for Biomedical Computing. iTools provides a system for classification, categorization and integration of different computational biology resources across space-and-time scales, biomedical problems, computational infrastructures and mathematical foundations. A large number of resources are already iTools-accessible to the community and this infrastructure is rapidly growing. iTools includes human and machine interfaces to its resource meta-data repository. Investigators or computer programs may utilize these interfaces to search, compare, expand, revise and mine meta-data descriptions of existent computational biology resources. We propose two ways to browse and display the iTools dynamic collection of resources. The first one is based on an ontology of computational biology resources, and the second one is derived from hyperbolic projections of manifolds or complex structures onto planar discs. iTools is an open source project both in terms of the source code development as well as its meta-data content. iTools employs a decentralized, portable, scalable and lightweight framework for long-term resource management. We demonstrate several applications of iTools as a framework for integrated bioinformatics. iTools and the complete details about its specifications, usage and interfaces are available at the iTools web page http://iTools.ccb.ucla.edu.

This loss of precision can be inappropriate, especially if the desired output is a ranked list of individual genes. To address this shortcoming, we developed M-BISON (Microarray-Based Integration of data SOurces using Networks), a formal probabilistic model that integrates background biological knowledge with microarray data to predict individual DE genes.M-BISON improves signal detection on a range of simulated data, particularly when using very noisy microarray data. We also applied the method to the task of predicting heat shock-related differentially expressed genes in S. cerevisiae, using an hsf1 mutant microarray dataset and conserved yeast DNA sequence motifs. Our results demonstrate that M-BISON improves the analysis quality and makes predictions that are easy to interpret in concert with incorporated knowledge. Specifically, M-BISON increases the AUC of DE gene prediction from .541 to .623 when compared to a method using only microarray data, and M-BISON outperforms a related method, GeneRank. Furthermore, by analyzing M-BISON predictions in the context of the background knowledge, we identified YHR124W as a potentially novel player in the yeast heat shock response.This work provides a solid foundation for the principled integration of imperfect biological knowledge with gene expression data and other high-throughput data sources.

However, because complete deletion of most yeast genes ( approximately 80%) has no obvious phenotypic consequence in rich medium, it is difficult to study their functions. To uncover phenotypes for this nonessential fraction of the genome, we performed 1144 chemical genomic assays on the yeast whole-genome heterozygous and homozygous deletion collections and quantified the growth fitness of each deletion strain in the presence of chemical or environmental stress conditions. We found that 97% of gene deletions exhibited a measurable growth phenotype, suggesting that nearly all genes are essential for optimal growth in at least one condition.

The conformational heterogeneity and partially folded nature of most of these states has rendered their characterization by high-resolution structural approaches difficult or even intractable. Here we introduce a method to rapidly infer the tertiary helical arrangements of large RNA molecules in their native and non-native solution states. Multiplexed hydroxyl radical (.OH) cleavage analysis (MOHCA) enables the high-throughput detection of numerous pairs of contacting residues via random incorporation of radical cleavage agents followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We validated this technology by recapitulating the unfolded and native states of a well studied model RNA, the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, at subhelical resolution. We then applied MOHCA to a recently discovered third state of the P4-P6 RNA that is stabilized by high concentrations of monovalent salt and whose partial order precludes conventional techniques for structure determination. The three-dimensional portrait of a compact, non-native RNA state reveals a well ordered subset of native tertiary contacts, in contrast to the dynamic but otherwise similar molten globule states of proteins. With its applicability to nearly any solution state, we expect MOHCA to be a powerful tool for illuminating the many functional structures of large RNA molecules and RNA/protein complexes.

However, ad-hoc retrieval systems do not meet all of the needs of databases that curate information from literature, or of text miners developing a corpus on a topic that has many terms indicative of relevance. Several databases have developed supervised learning methods that operate on a filtered subset of Medline, to classify Medline records so that fewer articles have to be manually reviewed for relevance. A few studies have considered generalisation of Medline classification to operate on the entire Medline database in a non-domain-specific manner, but existing applications lack speed, available implementations, or a means to measure performance in new domains.MScanner is an implementation of a Bayesian classifier that provides a simple web interface for submitting a corpus of relevant training examples in the form of PubMed IDs and returning results ranked by decreasing probability of relevance. For maximum speed it uses the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and journal of publication as a concise document representation, and takes roughly 90 seconds to return results against the 16 million records in Medline. The web interface provides interactive exploration of the results, and cross validated performance evaluation on the relevant input against a random subset of Medline. We describe the classifier implementation, cross validate it on three domain-specific topics, and compare its performance to that of an expert PubMed query for a complex topic. In cross validation on the three sample topics against 100,000 random articles, the classifier achieved excellent separation of relevant and irrelevant article score distributions, ROC areas between 0.97 and 0.99, and averaged precision between 0.69 and 0.92.MScanner is an effective non-domain-specific classifier that operates on the entire Medline database, and is suited to retrieving topics for which many features may indicate relevance. Its web interface simplifies the task of classifying Medline citations, compared to building a pre-filter and classifier specific to the topic. The data sets and open source code used to obtain the results in this paper are available on-line and as supplementary material, and the web interface may be accessed at http://mscanner.stanford.edu.

Consequently, the community requires standard formats to exchange large amounts of diverse information. To facilitate the transfer of pharmacogenomics data between databases and analysis packages, we have created a standard XML (eXtensible Markup Language) schema that describes both genotype and phenotype data as well as associated metadata. The schema accommodates information regarding genes, drugs, diseases, experimental methods, genomic/RNA/protein sequences, subjects, subject groups, and literature.

Although developed in the context of pharmacogenomics, the schema is of general utility for exchange of genotype and phenotype data.

These protocols are implemented in the software SAFA (semi-automated footprinting analysis) that can be downloaded without charge from http://safa.stanford.edu. The protocols implemented in SAFA have five steps: (i) lane identification, (ii) gel rectification, (iii) band assignment, (iv) model fitting and (v) band-intensity normalization. SAFA enables the rapid quantitation of gel images containing thousands of discrete bands, thereby eliminating a bottleneck to the analysis of chemical mapping experiments. An experienced user of the software can quantify a gel image in approximately 20 min. Although SAFA was developed to analyze hydroxyl radical (*OH) footprints, it effectively quantifies the gel images obtained with other types of chemical mapping probes. We also present a series of tutorial movies that illustrate the best practices and different steps in the SAFA analysis as a supplement to this protocol.

Possible functions can be predicted based on sequence similarity, genomic context, expression patterns, structure similarity, and combinations of these. We investigated whether simulations of protein dynamics can expose functional sites that are not apparent to the structure-based function prediction methods in static crystal structures. Focusing on Ca2+ binding, we coupled a machine learning tool that recognizes functional sites, FEATURE, with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

Because the residues that coordinate a metal often undergo conformational changes upon binding, detection of binding sites based on simple geometric criteria in proteins without bound metal is difficult. However, aspects of the physicochemical environment around a metal binding site are often conserved even when this structural rearrangement occurs. We have developed a Bayesian classifier using known zinc binding sites as positive training examples and nonmetal binding regions that nonetheless contain residues frequently observed in zinc sites as negative training examples. In order to allow variation in the exact positions of atoms, we average a variety of biochemical and biophysical properties in six concentric spherical shells around the site of interest. At a specificity of 99.8%, this method achieves 75.5% sensitivity in unbound proteins at a positive predictive value of 73.6%. We also test its accuracy on predicted protein structures obtained by homology modeling using templates with 30%-50% sequence identity to the target sequences. At a specificity of 99.8%, we correctly identify at least one zinc binding site in 65.5% of modeled proteins. Thus, in many cases, our model is accurate enough to identify metal binding sites in proteins of unknown structure for which no high sequence identity homologs of known structure exist.

The pathway is predicted using only a combination of distance constraints between contiguous residues and evolutionary data. We applied this analysis to find pathways of conserved residues connecting the myosin ATP binding site to the lever arm. These pathway residues may mediate the allosteric communication that couples ATP hydrolysis to the lever arm recovery stroke. Having examined pre-stroke conformations of Dictyostelium, scallop, and chicken myosin II as well as Dictyostelium myosin I, we observed a conserved pathway traversing switch II and the relay helix, which is consistent with the understood need for allosteric communication in this conformation. We also examined post-rigor and rigor conformations across several myosin species. Although initial residues of these paths are more heterogeneous, all but one of these paths traverse a consistent set of relay helix residues to reach the beginning of the lever arm. We discuss our results in the context of structural elements and reported mutational experiments, which substantiate the significance of the pre-stroke pathways. Our method provides a simple, computationally efficient means of predicting a set of residues that mediate allosteric communication.

Molecular density constrains models by specifying where atoms should and should not be. Low-resolution density information can often be obtained relatively quickly, and there is a need for methods that use it effectively. We have previously described a method for scoring molecular models with surface envelopes to discriminate between plausible and implausible fits. We showed that we could successfully filter out models with the wrong shape based on this discrimination power. Ideally, however, surface information should be used during the modeling process to constrain the conformations that are sampled. In this paper, we describe an extension of our method for using shape information during computational modeling. We use the envelope scoring metric as part of an objective function in a global optimization that also optimizes distances and angles while avoiding collisions. We systematically tested surface representations of proteins (using all nonhydrogen heavy atoms) with different abundance of distance information and showed that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of models built with envelope information is consistently improved, particularly in data sets with relatively small sets of short-range distances.

In an A-form RNA helix, base-stacking results in nearly perfect parallel orientations of all bases in the helix. Interestingly, when an RNA structure containing multiple helices is visualized at the atomic level, it is often possible to find an orientation such that only the edges of most bases are visible. This suggests that a general aspect of higher level RNA structure is a coplanar arrangement of base-normal vectors. We have analyzed all solved RNA crystal structures to determine the degree to which RNA base-normal vectors are globally coplanar. Using a statistical test based on the Watson-Girdle distribution, we determined that 330 out of 331 known RNA structures show statistically significant (p < 0.05; false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.05) coplanar normal vector orientations. Not surprisingly, 94% of the helices in RNA show bipolar arrangements of their base-normal vectors (p < 0.05). This allows us to compute a mean axis for each helix and compare their orientations within an RNA structure. This analysis revealed that 62% (208/331) of the RNA structures exhibit statistically significant coaxial packing of helices (p < 0.05, FDR = 0.08). Further analysis reveals that the bases in hairpin loops and junctions are also generally planar. This work demonstrates coplanar base orientation and coaxial helix packing as an emergent behavior of RNA structure and may be useful as a structural modeling constraint.

This integrated approach allows us to define the folding landscape of the L-21 Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron structurally and kinetically from its earliest steps with unprecedented accuracy. Distinct parallel pathways leading the RNA to its native form upon its Mg(2+)-induced folding are observed. The structures of the intermediates populating the pathways are not affected by variation of the concentration and type of background monovalent ions (electrostatic environment) but are altered by a mutation that destabilizes one domain of the ribozyme. Experiments starting from different conformational ensembles but folding under identical conditions show that whereas the electrostatic environment modulates molecular flux through different pathways, the initial conformational ensemble determines the partitioning of the flux. This study showcases a robust approach for the development of kinetic models from collections of local structural probes.

Structure-based annotation of molecular function is therefore becoming critical. We previously presented FEATURE, a method for describing microenvironments around functional sites in proteins. However, FEATURE uses supervised machine learning and so is limited to building models for sites of known importance and location. We hypothesized that there are a large number of sites in proteins that are associated with function that have not yet been recognized. Toward that end, we have developed a method for clustering protein microenvironments in order to evaluate the potential for discovering novel sites that have not been previously identified.We have prototyped a computational method for rapid clustering of millions of microenvironments in order to discover residues whose surrounding environments are similar and which may therefore share a functional or structural role. We clustered nearly 2,000,000 environments from 9,600 protein chains and defined 4,550 clusters. As a preliminary validation, we asked whether known 3D environments associated with PROSITE motifs were \"rediscovered\". We found examples of clusters highly enriched for residues that share PROSITE sequence motifs.Our results demonstrate that we can cluster protein environments successfully using a simplified representation and K-means clustering algorithm. The rediscovery of known 3D motifs allows us to calibrate the size and intercluster distances that characterize useful clusters. This information will then allow us to find new clusters with similar characteristics that represent novel structural or functional sites.

Reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) provide reliable medical evidence about the efficacy of treatments. Current methods to access, search for, and retrieve RCTs are keyword-based, time-consuming, and suffer from poor precision. Personalized semantic search and medical evidence summarization aim to solve this problem. The performance of these approaches may improve if they have access to study subject descriptors (e.g. age, gender, and ethnicity), trial sizes, and diseases/symptoms studied. We have developed a novel method to automatically extract such subject demographic information from RCT abstracts. We used text classification augmented with a Hidden Markov Model to identify sentences containing subject demographics, and subsequently these sentences were parsed using Natural Language Processing techniques to extract relevant information.

Variations in single genes are 1 well-recognized cause of such unpredictability, defining the field of pharmacogenetics (see Glossary). Such variations may involve genes controlling drug metabolism, drug transport, disease susceptibility, or drug targets. The sequencing of the human genome and the cataloguing of variants across human genomes are the enabling resources for the nascent field of pharmacogenomics (see Glossary), which tests the idea that genomic variability underlies variability in drug responses. However, there are many challenges that must be overcome to apply rapidly accumulating genomic information to understand variable drug responses, including defining candidate genes and pathways; relating disease genes to drug response genes; precisely defining drug response phenotypes; and addressing analytic, ethical, and technological issues involved in generation and management of large drug response data sets. Overcoming these challenges holds the promise of improving new drug development and ultimately individualizing the selection of appropriate drugs and dosages for individual patients.

Unique insight into the structural dynamics of these intermediates can be gleaned from the time-dependent changes in local probes of macromolecular conformation (e.g. reports on individual nucleotide solvent accessibility offered by hydroxyl radical (()OH) footprinting). Local measures distributed around a macromolecule individually illuminate the ensemble of separate changes that constitute a folding reaction. Folding pathway reconstruction from a multitude of these individual measures is daunting due to the combinatorial explosion of possible kinetic models as the number of independent local measures increases. Fortunately, clustering of time progress curves sufficiently reduces the dimensionality of the data so as to make reconstruction computationally tractable. The most likely folding topology and intermediates can then be identified by exhaustively enumerating all possible kinetic models on a super-computer grid. The folding pathways and measures of the relative flux through them were determined for Mg(2+) and Na(+)-mediated folding of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron using this combined experimental and computational approach. The flux during Mg(2+)-mediated folding is divided among numerous parallel pathways. In contrast, the flux during the Na(+)-mediated reaction is predominantly restricted through three pathways, one of which is without detectable passage through intermediates. Under both conditions, the folding reaction is highly parallel with no single pathway accounting for more than 50% of the molecular flux. This suggests that RNA folding is non-sequential under a variety of different experimental conditions even at the earliest stages of folding. This study provides a template for the systematic analysis of the time-evolution of RNA structure from ensembles of local measures that will illuminate the chemical and physical characteristics of each step in the process. The applicability of this analysis approach to other macromolecules is discussed.

The correlations between SNPs, however, make it possible to select a parsimonious set of informative SNPs, known as \"tagging\" SNPs, able to capture most variation in a population. Considerable research interest has recently focused on the development of methods for finding such SNPs. In this paper, we present an efficient method for finding tagging SNPs. The method does not involve computation-intensive search for SNP subsets but discards redundant SNPs using a feature selection algorithm. In contrast to most existing methods, the method presented here does not limit itself to using only correlations between SNPs in local groups. By using correlations that occur across different chromosomal regions, the method can reduce the number of globally redundant SNPs. Experimental results show that the number of tagging SNPs selected by our method is smaller than by using block-based methods. Supplementary website: http://htsnp.stanford.edu/FSFS/. View details for PubMedID 16819782 The aim of the RNA Ontology Consortium (ROC) is to create an integrated conceptual framework-an RNA Ontology (RO)-with a common, dynamic, controlled, and structured vocabulary to describe and characterize RNA sequences, secondary structures, three-dimensional structures, and dynamics pertaining to RNA function. The RO should produce tools for clear communication about RNA structure and function for multiple uses, including the integration of RNA electronic resources into the Semantic Web. These tools should allow the accurate description in computer-interpretable form of the coupling between RNA architecture, function, and evolution. The purposes for creating the RO are, therefore, (1) to integrate sequence and structural databases; (2) to allow different computational tools to interoperate; (3) to create powerful software tools that bring advanced computational methods to the bench scientist; and (4) to facilitate precise searches for all relevant information pertaining to RNA. For example, one initial objective of the ROC is to define, identify, and classify RNA structural motifs described in the literature or appearing in databases and to agree on a computer-interpretable definition for each of these motifs. To achieve these aims, the ROC will foster communication and promote collaboration among RNA scientists by coordinating frequent face-to-face workshops to discuss, debate, and resolve difficult conceptual issues. These meeting opportunities will create new directions at various levels of RNA research. The ROC will work closely with the PDB/NDB structural databases and the Gene, Sequence, and Open Biomedical Ontology Consortia to integrate the RO with existing biological ontologies to extend existing content while maintaining interoperability.

However, the realization of these expectations has been hampered by the lack of essential data on genotype--drug-response phenotype associations. We therefore propose a follow-up to the Human Genome Project: forming global consortia devoted to archiving and analysing group and individual patient data on associations between genotypes and drug-response phenotypes. Here, we discuss the rationale for such personalized medicine databases, and the key practical and ethical issues that need to be addressed in their establishment.

We have developed a sequence-independent method called S-BLEST (Structure-Based Local Environment Search Tool) for the annotation of previously uncharacterized protein structures. S-BLEST encodes the local environment of an amino acid as a vector of structural property values. It has been applied to all amino acids in a nonredundant database of protein structures to generate a searchable structural resource. Given a query amino acid from an experimentally determined or modeled structure, S-BLEST quickly identifies similar amino acid environments using a K-nearest neighbor search. In addition, the method gives an estimation of the statistical significance of each result. We validated S-BLEST on X-ray crystal structures from the ASTRAL 40 nonredundant dataset. We then applied it to 86 crystallographically determined proteins in the protein data bank (PDB) with unknown function and with no significant sequence neighbors in the PDB. S-BLEST was able to associate 20 proteins with at least one local structural neighbor and identify the amino acid environments that are most similar between those neighbors.

We surveyed PN formalisms and tools and compared them based on their mathematical capabilities as well as by their appropriateness to represent typical biological processes. We measured the ability of these tools to model specific features of biological systems and answer a set of biological questions that we defined. We found that different tools are required to provide all capabilities that we assessed. We created software to translate a generic PN model into most of the formalisms and tools discussed. We have also made available three models and suggest that a library of such models would catalyze progress in qualitative modeling via PNs. Development and wide adoption of common formats would enable researchers to share models and use different tools to analyze them without the need to convert to proprietary formats.

However, quantitative analysis of the gel images produced by footprinting experiments is tedious and time-consuming, due to the absence of informatics tools specifically designed for footprinting analysis. We have developed SAFA, a semi-automated footprinting analysis software package that achieves accurate gel quantification while reducing the time to analyze a gel from several hours to 15 min or less. The increase in analysis speed is achieved through a graphical user interface that implements a novel methodology for lane and band assignment, called \"gel rectification,\" and an optimized band deconvolution algorithm. The SAFA software yields results that are consistent with published methodologies and reduces the investigator-dependent variability compared to less automated methods. These software developments simplify the analysis procedure for a footprinting gel and can therefore facilitate the use of quantitative footprinting techniques in nucleic acid laboratories that otherwise might not have considered their use. Further, the increased throughput provided by SAFA may allow a more comprehensive understanding of molecular interactions.

It is difficult to manually extract useful information embedded in the large volumes of literature, and automated intelligent text analysis tools are becoming increasingly essential to assist in these curation activities. The goal of the authors was to develop an automated method to identify articles in Medline citations that contain pharmacogenetics data pertaining to gene-drug relationships.The authors built and evaluated several candidate statistical models that characterize pharmacogenetics articles in terms of word usage and the profile of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) used in those articles. The best-performing model was used to scan the entire Medline article database (11 million articles) to identify candidate pharmacogenetics articles.A sampling of the articles identified from scanning Medline was reviewed by a pharmacologist to assess the precision of the method. The authors' approach identified 4,892 pharmacogenetics articles in the literature with 92% precision. Their automated method took a fraction of the time to acquire these articles compared with the time expected to be taken to accumulate them manually. The authors have built a Web resource (http://pharmdemo.stanford.edu/pharmdb/main.spy) to provide access to their results.A statistical classification approach can screen the primary literature to pharmacogenetics articles with high precision.

These abbreviations are pervasive in all aspects of biology and medicine and as the amount of biomedical literature grows, so does the number of abbreviations and the average number of definitions per abbreviation. Even more confusing, different authors will often abbreviate the same word/phrase differently. This ambiguity impedes our ability to retrieve information, integrate databases and mine textual databases for content. Efforts to standardize nomenclature, especially those doing so retrospectively, need to be aware of different abbreviatory mappings and spelling variations. To address this problem, there have been several efforts to develop computer algorithms to identify the mapping of terms between short and long form within a large body of literature. To date, four such algorithms have been applied to create online databases that comprehensively map biomedical terms and abbreviations within MEDLINE: ARGH (http://lethargy.swmed.edu/ARGH/argh.asp), the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server (http://bionlp.stanford.edu/abbreviation/), AcroMed (http://medstract.med.tufts.edu/acro1.1/index.htm) and SaRAD (http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/projects/abbrev.html).

View details for PubMedID 16100408 The immense volume and rapid growth of human genomic data, especially single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), present special challenges for both biomedical researchers and automatic algorithms. One such challenge is to select an optimal subset of SNPs, commonly referred as \"haplotype tagging SNPs\" (htSNPs), to capture most of the haplotype diversity of each haplotype block or gene-specific region. This information-reduction process facilitates cost-effective genotyping and, subsequently, genotype-phenotype association studies. It also has implications for assessing the risk of identifying research subjects on the basis of SNP information deposited in public domain databases. We have investigated methods for selecting htSNPs by use of principal components analysis (PCA). These methods first identify eigenSNPs and then map them to actual SNPs. We evaluated two mapping strategies, greedy discard and varimax rotation, by assessing the ability of the selected htSNPs to reconstruct genotypes of non-htSNPs. We also compared these methods with two other htSNP finders, one of which is PCA based. We applied these methods to three experimental data sets and found that the PCA-based methods tend to select the smallest set of htSNPs to achieve a 90% reconstruction precision.

The National Library of Medicine (NLM) distributes MEDLINE in eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-formatted text files, but it is difficult to query MEDLINE in that format. We have developed software tools to parse the MEDLINE data files and load their contents into a relational database. Although the task is conceptually straightforward, the size and scope of MEDLINE make the task nontrivial. Given the increasing importance of text analysis in biology and medicine, we believe a local installation of MEDLINE will provide helpful computing infrastructure for researchers.We developed three software packages that parse and load MEDLINE, and ran each package to install separate instances of the MEDLINE database. For each installation, we collected data on loading time and disk-space utilization to provide examples of the process in different settings. Settings differed in terms of commercial database-management system (IBM DB2 or Oracle 9i), processor (Intel or Sun), programming language of installation software (Java or Perl), and methods employed in different versions of the software. The loading times for the three installations were 76 hours, 196 hours, and 132 hours, and disk-space utilization was 46.3 GB, 37.7 GB, and 31.6 GB, respectively. Loading times varied due to a variety of differences among the systems. Loading time also depended on whether data were written to intermediate files or not, and on whether input files were processed in sequence or in parallel. Disk-space utilization depended on the number of MEDLINE files processed, amount of indexing, and whether abstracts were stored as character large objects or truncated.Relational database (RDBMS) technology supports indexing and querying of very large datasets, and can accommodate a locally stored version of MEDLINE. RDBMS systems support a wide range of queries and facilitate certain tasks that are not directly supported by the application programming interface to PubMed. Because there is variation in hardware, software, and network infrastructures across sites, we cannot predict the exact time required for a user to load MEDLINE, but our results suggest that performance of the software is reasonable.

Currently, this useful information has not been comprehensively aggregated in any database and remains scattered throughout the published literature. Although there are efforts to collect this information manually, they are limited by the size of the published literature on gene-drug relationships. Therefore, we investigated computational methods to extract and characterize pharmacogenetic relationships between genes and drugs from the literature. We first evaluated the effectiveness of the co-occurrence method in identifying related genes and drugs. We then used supervised machine learning algorithms to classify the relationships between genes and drugs from the Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) into five categories that have been defined by active pharmacogenetic researchers as relevant to their work. The final co-occurrence algorithm was able to extract 78% of the related genes and drugs that were published in a review article from the literature. Our algorithm subsequently classified the relationships between genes and drugs from the PharmGKB into five categories with 74% accuracy. We have made the data available on a supplementary website at http://bionlp.stanford.edu/genedrug/ Gene-drug relationships can be accurately extracted from text and classified into categories. Although the relationships that we have identified do not capture the details and fine distinctions often made in the literature, these methods will help scientists to track the ever-growing literature and create information resources to support future discoveries.

This project capitalized on the rapidly expanding interest in the role of computation in basic biological research, well characterized in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI) report. The defining activity of the project was the three-day 2002 Annual Symposium of the College. A committee, comprised of the authors of this report, subsequently carried out activities, including interviews with a broader informatics and biological sciences constituency, collation and categorization of observations, and generation of recommendations. The committee viewed biomedical informatics as an interdisciplinary field, combining basic informational and computational sciences with application domains, including health care, biological research, and education. Consequently, effective training in informatics, viewed from a national perspective, should encompass four key elements: (1). curricula that integrate experiences in the computational sciences and application domains rather than just concatenating them; (2). diversity among trainees, with individualized, interdisciplinary cross-training allowing each trainee to develop key competencies that he or she does not initially possess; (3). direct immersion in research and development activities; and (4). exposure across the wide range of basic informational and computational sciences. Informatics training programs that implement these features, irrespective of their funding sources, will meet and exceed the challenges raised by the BISTI report, and optimally prepare their trainees for careers in a field that continues to evolve.

However, deciding which gene products are ideal drug/vaccine targets remains a difficult task. Currently, a systematic disruption of every single gene in Plasmodium is technically challenging. Hence, we have developed a computational approach to prioritize potential targets. A pathway/genome database (PGDB) integrates pathway information with information about the complete genome of an organism. We have constructed PlasmoCyc, a PGDB for Plasmodium falciparum 3D7, using its annotated genomic sequence. In addition to the annotations provided in the genome database, we add 956 additional annotations to proteins annotated as \"hypothetical\" using the GeneQuiz annotation system. We apply a novel computational algorithm to PlasmoCyc to identify 216 \"chokepoint enzymes.\" All three clinically validated drug targets are chokepoint enzymes. A total of 87.5% of proposed drug targets with biological evidence in the literature are chokepoint reactions. Therefore, identifying chokepoint enzymes represents one systematic way to identify potential metabolic drug targets.

We systematically analyzed known human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulatory elements and discovered that human regulatory elements are more conserved between human and mouse than are background sequences. Although S. cerevisiae regulatory elements do not appear to be more conserved by comparison of S. cerevisiae to Schizosaccharomyces pombe, they are more conserved when compared with multiple other yeast genomes (Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, and Saccharomyces bayanus). Based on these analyses, we developed a sequence-motif-finding algorithm called CompareProspector, which extends Gibbs sampling by biasing the search in regions conserved across species. Using human-mouse comparison, CompareProspector identified known motifs for transcription factors Mef2, Myf, Srf, and Sp1 from a set of human-muscle-specific genes. It also discovered the NFAT motif from genes up-regulated by CD28 stimulation in T-cells, which implies the direct involvement of NFAT in mediating the CD28 stimulatory signal. Using Caenorhabditis elegans-Caenorhabditis briggsae comparison, CompareProspector found the PHA-4 motif and the UNC-86 motif. CompareProspector outperformed many other computational motif-finding programs, demonstrating the power of comparative genomics-based biased sampling in eukaryotic regulatory element identification.

We demonstrate that shape information alone can often distinguish structural models of biological macromolecules. By using a data structure called a surface envelope (SE) to represent the shape of the molecule, we propose a method that generates a fitness score for the shape of a particular molecular model. This score correlates well with root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the model to the known test structures and can be used to filter models in decoy sets. The scoring method requires both alignment of the model to the SE in three-dimensional space and assessment of the degree to which atoms in the model fill the SE. Alignment combines a hybrid algorithm using principal components and a previously published iterated closest point algorithm. We test our method against models generated from random atom perturbation from crystal structures, published decoy sets used in structure prediction, and models created from the trajectories of atoms in molecular modeling runs. We also test our alignment algorithm against experimental electron microscopic data from rice dwarf virus. The alignment performance is reliable, and we show a high correlation between model RMSD and score function. This correlation is stronger for molecular models with greater oblong character (as measured by the ratio of largest to smallest principal component).

To augment the static crystallographic models with dynamic information present in crosslink, footprint, and cleavage data, we examined 2691 proximity measurements and focused on the subset that was apparently incompatible with >40 published crystal structures. The measurements from this subset generally involve regions of the structure that are functionally conserved and structurally flexible. Local movements in the crystallographic states of the ribosome that would satisfy biochemical proximity measurements show coherent patterns suggesting alternative conformations of the ribosome. Three different types of data obtained for the two subunits display similar \"mismatching\" patterns, suggesting that the signals are robust and real. In particular, there is an indication of coherent motion in the decoding region within the 30S subunit and central protuberance and surrounding areas of the 50S subunit. Directions of rearrangements fluctuate around the proposed path of tRNA translocation and the plane parallel to the interface of the two subunits.

Hypoxic tumors have altered physiologic processes, including increased regions of angiogenesis, increased local invasion, increased distant metastasis and altered apoptotic programs. Since hypoxia is a potent controller of gene expression, identifying hypoxia-regulated genes is a means to investigate the molecular response to hypoxic stress. Traditional experimental approaches have identified physiologic changes in hypoxic cells. Recent studies have identified hypoxia-responsive genes that may define the mechanism(s) underlying these physiologic changes. For example, the regulation of glycolytic genes by hypoxia can explain some characteristics of the Warburg effect. The converse of this logic is also true. By identifying new classes of hypoxia-regulated gene(s), we can infer the physiologic pressures that require the induction of these genes and their protein products. Furthermore, these physiologically driven hypoxic gene expression changes give us insight as to the poor outcome of patients with hypoxic tumors. Approximately 1-1.5% of the genome is transcriptionally responsive to hypoxia. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the transcriptional response to hypoxia between different cell types. Moreover, the coordinated change in the expression of families of genes supports the model of physiologic pressure leading to expression changes. Understanding the evolutionary pressure to develop a 'hypoxic response' provides a framework to investigate the biology of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

With the recent increase in the estimates of the number of human genes that undergo alternative splicing from 5 to 35-59%, it is becoming critical to develop a better understanding of its functional consequences and regulatory mechanisms. We conducted a large scale study of the distribution of protein domains in a curated data set of several thousand genes and identified protein domains disproportionately distributed among alternatively spliced genes. We also identified a number of protein domains that tend to be spliced out. Both the proteins having the disproportionately distributed domains as well as those with spliced-out domains are predominantly involved in the processes of cell communication, signaling, development and apoptosis. These proteins function mostly as enzymes, signal transducers and receptors. Somewhat surprisingly, 28% of all occurrences of spliced-out domains are not effected by straightforward exclusion of exons coding for the domains but by inclusion or exclusion of other exons to shift the reading frame while retaining the exons coding for the domains in the final transcripts.

We present a computational method that leverages the peer-reviewed literature in the automatic analysis of gene expression data sets. Including the literature in the analysis of gene expression data offers an opportunity to incorporate functional information about the genes when defining expression clusters. We have created a method that associates gene expression profiles with known biological functions. Our method has two steps. First, we apply hierarchical clustering to the given gene expression data set. Secondly, we use text from abstracts about genes to (i) resolve hierarchical cluster boundaries to optimize the functional coherence of the clusters and (ii) recognize those clusters that are most functionally coherent. In the case where a gene has not been investigated and therefore lacks primary literature, articles about well-studied homologous genes are added as references. We apply our method to two large gene expression data sets with different properties. The first contains measurements for a subset of well-studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes with multiple literature references, and the second contains newly discovered genes in Drosophila melanogaster; many have no literature references at all. In both cases, we are able to rapidly define and identify the biologically relevant gene expression profiles without manual intervention. In both cases, we identified novel clusters that were not noted by the original investigators.

The locations and function of bound Mg2+ ions are difficult to characterize both experimentally and computationally. In particular, the P456 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, and a 58 nt 23s rRNA from Escherichia coli have been important systems for studying the role of Mg2+ binding in RNA, but characteristics of all the binding sites remain unclear. We therefore investigated the Mg2+ binding capabilities of these RNA systems using a computational approach to identify and further characterize their Mg2+ binding sites. The approach is based on the FEATURE algorithm, reported previously for microenvironment analysis of protein functional sites. We have determined novel physicochemical descriptions of site-bound and diffusely bound Mg2+ ions in RNA that are useful for prediction. Electrostatic calculations using the Non-Linear Poisson Boltzmann (NLPB) equation provided further evidence for the locations of site-bound ions. We confirmed the locations of experimentally determined sites and further differentiated between classes of ion binding. We also identified potentially important, high scoring sites in the group I intron that are not currently annotated as Mg2+ binding sites. We note their potential function and believe they deserve experimental follow-up.

A variety of functional genomics experimental techniques are available, from classic methods such as affinity precipitation to advanced high-throughput techniques such as gene expression microarrays. In the future, more disparate methods will be developed, further increasing the need for integrated computational analysis of data generated by these studies. We address this problem with MAGIC (Multisource Association of Genes by Integration of Clusters), a general framework that uses formal Bayesian reasoning to integrate heterogeneous types of high-throughput biological data (such as large-scale two-hybrid screens and multiple microarray analyses) for accurate gene function prediction. The system formally incorporates expert knowledge about relative accuracies of data sources to combine them within a normative framework. MAGIC provides a belief level with its output that allows the user to vary the stringency of predictions. We applied MAGIC to Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic and physical interactions, microarray, and transcription factor binding sites data and assessed the biological relevance of gene groupings using Gene Ontology annotations produced by the Saccharomyces Genome Database. We found that by creating functional groupings based on heterogeneous data types, MAGIC improved accuracy of the groupings compared with microarray analysis alone. We describe several of the biological gene groupings identified.

WebFEATURE is the public interface to the scanning algorithm of the FEATURE package, a supervised learning algorithm for creating and identifying 3D, physicochemical motifs in molecular structures. Given an input structure or Protein Data Bank identifier (PDB ID), and a statistical model of a functional site, WebFEATURE will return rank-scored 'hits' in 3D space that identify regions in the structure where similar distributions of physicochemical properties occur relative to the site model. Users can visualize and interactively manipulate scored hits and the query structure in web browsers that support the Chime plug-in. Alternatively, results can be downloaded and visualized through other freely available molecular modeling tools, like RasMol, PyMOL and Chimera. A major application of WebFEATURE is in rapid annotation of function to structures in the context of structural genomics.

Although these strategies provide information on which genomic regions are likely to be involved in gene regulation, they do not give information on their functions. We have developed a functional selection for promoter regions in the human genome that uses a retroviral plasmid library-based system. This approach enriches for and detects promoter function of isolated DNA fragments in an in vitro cell culture assay. By using this method, we have discovered likely promoters of known and predicted genes, as well as many other putative promoter regions based on the presence of features such as CpG islands. Comparison of sequences of 858 plasmid clones selected by this assay with the human genome draft sequence indicates that a significantly higher percentage of sequences align to the 500-bp segment upstream of the transcription start sites of known genes than would be expected from random genomic sequences. We also observed enrichment for putative promoter regions of genes predicted in at least two annotation databases and for clones overlapping with CpG islands. Functional validation of randomly selected clones enriched by this method showed that a large fraction of these putative promoters can drive the expression of a reporter gene in transient transfection experiments. This method promises to be a useful genome-wide function-based approach that can complement existing methods to look for promoters.

Genes of interest for pharmacogenomics include genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, as well as genes that are drug targets. The past year has seen an increasing number of systematic surveys of genetic variation that establish reliable baseline measurements of sequence variation--at least in coding and promoter regions. These surveys form the basis for determination of population frequencies, genetic linkage studies and association studies relating genotype with drug response phenotypes of interest.

We present a method for distinguishing likely disease-causing mutations from mutations that are merely associated with disease but have no causal role. Our method uses a measure of nucleotide conservation, and we find that conservation often correlates with severity of the clinical phenotype. Further, by only including mutations whose pathogenicity has been proven experimentally, this correlation is enhanced in the case of prostate cancer-associated mutations. Our method provides a means for assessing the significance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cancer-associated mutations.

These profiles can then be used to recognize sites in large-scale automated annotations of new protein structures. We report an improved FEATURE system which recognizes functional sites in protein structures. FEATURE defines multi-level physico-chemical properties and recognizes sites based on the spatial distribution of these properties in the sites' microenvironments. It uses a Bayesian scoring function to compare a query region with the statistical profile built from known examples of sites and control nonsites. We have previously shown that FEATURE can accurately recognize calcium-binding sites and have reported interesting results scanning for calcium-binding sites in the entire Protein Data Bank. Here we report the ability of the improved FEATURE to characterize and recognize geometrically complex and asymmetric sites such as ATP-binding sites and disulfide bond-forming sites. FEATURE does not rely on conserved residues or conserved residue geometry of the sites. We also demonstrate that, in the absence of a statistical profile of the sites, FEATURE can use an artificially constructed profile based on a priori knowledge to recognize the sites in new structures, using redoxin active sites as an example.

The method requires only a corpus of documents and an index connecting the documents to genes.We evaluate NDPG on 2796 functional groups generated by the Gene Ontology consortium in four organisms: mouse, fly, worm and yeast.

The Gene Ontology (GO; http://www.geneontology.org) provides a taxonomy of concepts and their attributes for annotating gene products. As GO increases in size, its ongoing construction and maintenance becomes more challenging. In this paper, we assess the applicability of a Knowledge Base Management System (KBMS), Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-2000, to the maintenance and development of GO.We transferred GO to Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-2000 in order to evaluate its suitability for GO. The graphical user interface supported browsing and editing of GO. Tools for consistency checking identified minor inconsistencies in GO and opportunities to reduce redundancy in its representation. The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Axiom Language proved useful for checking ontological consistency. The PROMPT tool allowed us to track changes to GO. Using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-2000, we tested our ability to make changes and extensions to GO to refine the semantics of attributes and classify more concepts.Gene Ontology in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-2000 and the associated code are located at http://smi.stanford.edu/projects/helix/gokbms/.

For many of the structures, functions are not yet determined and high-throughput methods for determining function are necessary. Although there has been extensive work in function prediction at the sequence level, predicting function at the structure level may provide better sensitivity and predictive value. We describe a method to predict functional sites by automatically creating three dimensional structural motifs from amino acid sequence motifs. These structural motifs perform comparably well with manually generated structural motifs and perform better than sequence motifs. Automatically generated structural motifs can be used for structural-genomic scale function prediction on protein structures.

One such challenge derives from the common and uncontrolled use of abbreviations in the literature. Each additional abbreviation increases the effective size of the vocabulary for a field. Therefore, to create an automatically generated and maintained lexicon of abbreviations, we have developed an algorithm to match abbreviations in text with their expansions.Our method uses a statistical learning algorithm, logistic regression, to score abbreviation expansions based on their resemblance to a training set of human-annotated abbreviations. We applied it to Medstract, a corpus of MEDLINE abstracts in which abbreviations and their expansions have been manually annotated. We then ran the algorithm on all abstracts in MEDLINE, creating a dictionary of biomedical abbreviations. To test the coverage of the database, we used an independently created list of abbreviations from the China Medical Tribune.We measured the recall and precision of the algorithm in identifying abbreviations from the Medstract corpus. We also measured the recall when searching for abbreviations from the China Medical Tribune against the database.On the Medstract corpus, our algorithm achieves up to 83% recall at 80% precision. Applying the algorithm to all of MEDLINE yielded a database of 781,632 high-scoring abbreviations. Of all the abbreviations in the list from the China Medical Tribune, 88% were in the database.We have developed an algorithm to identify abbreviations from text.

In this study, we address the problem of robust identification of differentially expressed genes from microarray data. Differentially expressed genes, or discriminator genes, are genes with significantly different expression in two user-defined groups of microarray experiments. We compare three model-free approaches: (1). nonparametric t-test, (2). Wilcoxon (or Mann-Whitney) rank sum test, and (3). a heuristic method based on high Pearson correlation to a perfectly differentiating gene ('ideal discriminator method'). We systematically assess the performance of each method based on simulated and biological data under varying noise levels and p-value cutoffs.All methods exhibit very low false positive rates and identify a large fraction of the differentially expressed genes in simulated data sets with noise level similar to that of actual data. Overall, the rank sum test appears most conservative, which may be advantageous when the computationally identified genes need to be tested biologically. However, if a more inclusive list of markers is desired, a higher p-value cutoff or the nonparametric t-test may be appropriate. When applied to data from lung tumor and lymphoma data sets, the methods identify biologically relevant differentially expressed genes that allow clear separation of groups in question. Thus the methods described and evaluated here provide a convenient and robust way to identify differentially expressed genes for further biological and clinical analysis.

Often, as with gene expression clustering, there are too many groups to easily identify the functionally relevant ones. One valuable source of information about gene function is the published literature. We present a method, neighbor divergence, for assessing whether the genes within a group share a common biological function based on their associated scientific literature. The method uses statistical natural language processing techniques to interpret biological text. It requires only a corpus of documents relevant to the genes being studied (e.g., all genes in an organism) and an index connecting the documents to appropriate genes. Given a group of genes, neighbor divergence assigns a numerical score indicating how \"functionally coherent\" the gene group is from the perspective of the published literature. We evaluate our method by testing its ability to distinguish 19 known functional gene groups from 1900 randomly assembled groups. Neighbor divergence achieves 79% sensitivity at 100% specificity, comparing favorably to other tested methods. We also apply neighbor divergence to previously published gene expression clusters to assess its ability to recognize gene groups that had been manually identified as representative of a common function.

In addition, it has been hypothesized that this element is an important driving force behind genotypic variability that may have phenotypic consequences. We present here a novel, DNA microarray-based methodology, designated SiteMapping, that simultaneously maps the locations and orientations of multiple copies of IS6110 within the genome. To investigate the sensitivity, accuracy, and limitations of the technique, it was applied to eight Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains for which complete or partial IS6110 insertion site information had been determined previously. SiteMapping correctly located 64% (38 of 59) of the IS6110 copies predicted by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The technique is highly specific; 97% of the predicted insertion sites were true insertions. Eight previously unknown insertions were identified and confirmed by PCR or sequencing. The performance could be improved by modifications in the experimental protocol and in the approach to data analysis. SiteMapping has general applicability and demonstrates an expansion in the applications of microarrays that complements conventional approaches in the study of genome architecture.

The experimental study of protein function and gene regulation typically provides information at many levels. The representation of hierarchical process knowledge in biology is therefore a major challenge for bioinformatics. To represent high-level processes in the context of their component functions, we have developed a graphical knowledge model for biological processes that supports methods for qualitative reasoning.We assessed eleven diverse models that were developed in the fields of software engineering, business, and biology, to evaluate their suitability for representing and simulating biological processes. Based on this assessment, we combined the best aspects of two models: Workflow/Petri Net and a biological concept model. The Workflow model can represent nesting and ordering of processes, the structural components that participate in the processes, and the roles that they play. It also maps to Petri Nets, which allow verification of formal properties and qualitative simulation. The biological concept model, TAMBIS, provides a framework for describing biological entities that can be mapped to the workflow model. We tested our model by representing malaria parasites invading host erythrocytes, and composed queries, in five general classes, to discover relationships among processes and structural components. We used reachability analysis to answer queries about the dynamic aspects of the model.The model is available at http://smi.stanford.edu/projects/helix/pubs/process-model/.

To facilitate the interoperation of these programs, we propose a syntax to exchange basic RNA molecular information. This RNAML syntax allows for the storage and the exchange of information about RNA sequence and secondary and tertiary structures. The syntax permits the description of higher level information about the data including, but not restricted to, base pairs, base triples, and pseudoknots. A class-oriented approach allows us to represent data common to a given set of RNA molecules, such as a sequence alignment and a consensus secondary structure. Documentation about experiments and computations, as well as references to journals and external databases, are included in the syntax. The chief challenge in creating such a syntax was to determine the appropriate scope of usage and to ensure extensibility as new needs will arise. The syntax complies with the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) recommendations, a widely accepted standard for syntax specifications. In addition to the various generic packages that exist to read and interpret XML formats, an XML processor was developed and put in the open-source MC-Core library for nucleic acid and protein structure computer manipulation.

We assessed the correspondence between more than 2,500 experimental proximity measurements and the distances observed in the ribosomal crystals. Although detailed experimental procedures and protocols are unique in almost each analyzed paper, the data can be grouped into subsets with similar patterns and analyzed in an integrative fashion. We found that, for crosslinking, footprinting, and cleavage data, the corresponding distances observed in crystal structures generally did not exceed the maximum values expected (from the estimated length of the agent and maximal anticipated deviations from the conformations found in crystals). However, the distribution of distances had heavier tails than those typically assumed when building three-dimensional models, and the fraction of incompatible distances was greater than expected. Some of these incompatibilities can be attributed to the experimental methods used. In addition, the accuracy of these procedures appears to be sensitive to the different reactivities, flexibilities, and interactions among the components. These findings demonstrate the necessity of a very careful analysis of data used for structural modeling and consideration of all possible parameters that could potentially influence the quality of measurements. We conclude that experimental proximity measurements can provide useful distance information for structural modeling, but with a broad distribution of inferred distance ranges. We also conclude that development of automated modeling approaches would benefit from better annotations of experimental data for detection and interpretation of their significance.

The development of inexpensive DNA sequencing and analysis technologies promises unprecedented database access to very specific information about individuals. To allow analysis of this data without compromising the research subjects' privacy, we must develop methods for removing identifying information from medical and genomic data. In this paper, we build upon the idea that binned database records are more difficult to trace back to individuals. We represent symbolic and numeric data hierarchically, and bin them by generalizing the records. We measure the information loss due to binning using an information theoretic measure called mutual information. The results show that we can bin the data to different levels of precision and use the bin size to control the tradeoff between privacy and data resolution.

These discussions are extremely valuable for characterizing the functions not only of these gene products, but also of their homologs in other organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) is an effort to create a controlled terminology for labeling gene functions in a more precise, reliable, computer-readable manner. Currently, the best annotations of gene function with the GO are performed by highly trained biologists who read the literature and select appropriate codes. In this study, we explored the possibility that statistical natural language processing techniques can be used to assign GO codes. We compared three document classification methods (maximum entropy modeling, na\u00efve Bayes classification, and nearest-neighbor classification) to the problem of associating a set of GO codes (for biological process) to literature abstracts and thus to the genes associated with the abstracts. We showed that maximum entropy modeling outperforms the other methods and achieves an accuracy of 72% when ascertaining the function discussed within an abstract. The maximum entropy method provides confidence measures that correlate well with performance. We conclude that statistical methods may be used to assign GO codes and may be useful for the difficult task of reassignment as terminology standards evolve over time.

But because ontologies change and knowledge evolves, it is time consuming to maintain stable mappings to external data sources that are in relational format. We propose a method for interfacing ontology models with data acquisition from external relational data sources. This method uses a declarative interface between the ontology and the data source, and this interface is modeled in the ontology and implemented using XML schema. Data is imported from the relational source into the ontology using XML, and data integrity is checked by validating the XML submission with an XML schema. We have implemented this approach in PharmGKB (http://www.pharmgkb.org/), a pharmacogenetics knowledge base. Our goals were to (1) import genetic sequence data, collected in relational format, into the pharmacogenetics ontology, and (2) automate the process of updating the links between the ontology and data acquisition when the ontology changes. We tested our approach by linking PharmGKB with data acquisition from a relational model of genetic sequence information. The ontology subsequently evolved, and we were able to rapidly update our interface with the external data and continue acquiring the data. Similar approaches may be helpful for integrating other heterogeneous information sources in order make the diversity of pharmacogenetics data amenable to computational analysis. View details for PubMedID 11928521 The information model chosen to store biological data affects the types of queries possible, database performance, and difficulty in updating that information model. Genetic sequence data for pharmacogenetics studies can be complex, and the best information model to use may change over time. As experimental and analytical methods change, and as biological knowledge advances, the data storage requirements and types of queries needed may also change.We developed a model for genetic sequence and polymorphism data, and used XML Schema to specify the elements and attributes required for this model. We implemented this model as an ontology in a frame-based representation and as a relational model in a database system. We collected genetic data from two pharmacogenetics resequencing studies, and formulated queries useful for analysing these data. We compared the ontology and relational models in terms of query complexity, performance, and difficulty in changing the information model. Our results demonstrate benefits of evolving the schema for storing pharmacogenetics data: ontologies perform well in early design stages as the information model changes rapidly and simplify query formulation, while relational models offer improved query speed once the information model and types of queries needed stabilize.

A public repository of pharmacogenetic data should accelerate progress in the field of pharmacogenetics by organizing and disseminating public datasets. We are developing a pharmacogenetics knowledge base (PharmGKB) to support the storage and retrieval of both experimental data and conceptual knowledge. PharmGKB is an Internet-based resource that integrates complex biological, pharmacological, and clinical data in such a way that researchers can submit their data and users can retrieve information to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations. Successful management of the names, meaning, and organization of concepts used within the system is crucial.

Subdivision of the tumors based on gene expression patterns faithfully recapitulated morphological classification of the tumors into squamous, large cell, small cell, and adenocarcinoma. The gene expression patterns made possible the subclassification of adenocarcinoma into subgroups that correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation as well as patient survival. Gene expression analysis thus promises to extend and refine standard pathologic analysis.

Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data.We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1--20% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.

A wealth of recent reports uses microarray expression data to examine diverse biological phenomena - from basic processes in model organisms to complex aspects of human disease. After an initial flurry of methods for clustering the data on the basis of similarity, the field has recognized some longer-term challenges. Firstly, there are efforts to understand the sources of noise and variation in microarray experiments in order to increase the biological signal. Secondly, there are efforts to combine expression data with other sources of information to improve the range and quality of conclusions that can be drawn. Finally, techniques are now emerging to reconstruct networks of genetic interactions in order to create integrated and systematic models of biological systems.

These studies typically produce large data sets that contain measurements on thousands of genes under hundreds of conditions. There is a critical need to summarize this data and to pick out the important details. The most common activities, therefore, are to group together microarray data and to reduce the number of features. Both of these activities can be done using only the raw microarray data (unsupervised methods) or using external information that provides labels for the microarray data (supervised methods). We briefly review supervised and unsupervised methods for grouping and reducing data in the context of a publicly available suite of tools called CLEAVER, and illustrate their application on a representative data set collected to study lymphoma.

Although sequence similarity is only one of many indicators of evolutionary homology, it is often the only one used. Here we find that supplementing sequence similarity with information from biomedical literature is successful in increasing the accuracy of homology search results. We modified the PSI-BLAST algorithm to use literature similarity in each iteration of its database search. The modified algorithm is evaluated and compared to standard PSI-BLAST in searching for homologous proteins. The performance of the modified algorithm achieved 32% recall with 95% precision, while the original one achieved 33% recall with 84% precision; the literature similarity requirement preserved the sensitive characteristic of the PSI-BLAST algorithm while improving the precision.

In the post-genomic era, scientists must be able to quickly gain insight into structure-function problems, and require flexible computing environments to quickly create interfaces that link the relevant tools. Feature, a program for analyzing protein sites, takes a set of 3-dimensional structures and creates statistical models of sites of structural or functional significance. Until now, Feature has provided no support for visualization, which can make understanding its results difficult. We have developed an extension to the molecular visualization program Chimera that integrates Feature's statistical models and site predictions with 3-dimensional structures viewed in Chimera. We call this extension ViewFeature, and it is designed to help users understand the structural Features that define a site of interest. We applied ViewFeature in an analysis of the enolase superfamily; a functionally distinct class of proteins that share a common fold, the alpha/beta barrel, in order to gain a more complete understanding of the conserved physical properties of this superfamily. In particular, we wanted to define the structural determinants that distinguish the enolase superfamily active site scaffold from other alpha/beta barrel superfamilies and particularly from other metal-binding alpha/beta barrel proteins. Through the use of ViewFeature, we have found that the C-terminal domain of the enolase superfamily does not differ at the scaffold level from metal-binding alpha/beta barrels. We are, however, able to differentiate between the metal-binding sites of alpha/beta barrels and those of other metal-binding proteins. We describe the overall architectural Features of enolases in a radius of 10 Angstroms around the active site. View details for PubMedID 11262944 Given the high rate at which biological data are being collected and made public, it is essential that computational tools be developed that are capable of efficiently accessing and analyzing these data. High-performance distributed computing resources can play a key role in enabling large-scale analyses of biological databases. We use a distributed computing environment, Legion, to enable large-scale computations on the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In particular, we employ the Feature program to scan all protein structures in the PDB in search for unrecognized potential cation binding sites. We evaluate the efficiency of Legion's parallel execution capabilities and analyze the initial biological implications that result from having a site annotation scan of the entire PDB. We discuss four interesting proteins with unannotated, high-scoring candidate cation binding sites.

Optimization methods must be able to find atomic configurations that are close to the absolute, or global, minimum error and also satisfy known physical constraints such as minimum separation distances between atoms (based on van der Waals interactions). The most difficult obstacles in these types of problems are that 1) using a limited amount of input data leads to many possible local optima and 2) introducing physical constraints, such as minimum separation distances, helps to limit the search space but often makes convergence to a global minimum more difficult. We introduce a constrained global optimization algorithm that is robust and efficient in yielding near-optimal three-dimensional configurations that are guaranteed to satisfy known separation constraints. The algorithm uses an atom-based approach that reduces the dimensionality and allows for tractable enforcement of constraints while maintaining good global convergence properties. We evaluate the new optimization algorithm using synthetic data from the yeast phenylalanine tRNA and several proteins, all with known crystal structure taken from the Protein Data Bank. We compare the results to commonly applied optimization methods, such as distance geometry, simulated annealing, continuation, and smoothing. We show that compared to other optimization approaches, our algorithm is able combine sparse input data with physical constraints in an efficient manner to yield structures with lower root mean squared deviation.

The interest in applying informatics techniques to both clinical problems and problems in basic science can be traced to the Dendral project in the 1960s. Having bioinformatics and clinical informatics in the same academic unit is still somewhat unusual and can lead to clashes of clinical and basic science cultures. Nevertheless, the benefits of this organization have recently become clear, as the landscape of academic medicine in the next decades has begun to emerge. The author provides examples of technology transfer between clinical informatics and bioinformatics that illustrate how they complement each other. View details for PubMedID 10984462 The many interactions of tRNA with the ribosome are fundamental to protein synthesis. During the peptidyl transferase reaction, the acceptor ends of the aminoacyl and peptidyl tRNAs must be in close proximity to allow peptide bond formation, and their respective anticodons must base pair simultaneously with adjacent trinucleotide codons on the mRNA. The two tRNAs in this state can be arranged in two nonequivalent general configurations called the R and S orientations, many versions of which have been proposed for the geometry of tRNAs in the ribosome. Here, we report the combined use of computational analysis and tethered hydroxyl-radical probing to constrain their arrangement. We used Fe(II) tethered to the 5' end of anticodon stem-loop analogs (ASLs) of tRNA and to the 5' end of deacylated tRNA(Phe) to generate hydroxyl radicals that probe proximal positions in the backbone of adjacent tRNAs in the 70S ribosome. We inferred probe-target distances from the resulting RNA strand cleavage intensities and used these to calculate the mutual arrangement of A-site and P-site tRNAs in the ribosome, using three different structure estimation algorithms. The two tRNAs are constrained to the S configuration with an angle of about 45 degrees between the respective planes of the molecules. The terminal phosphates of 3'CCA are separated by 23 A when using the tRNA crystal conformations, and the anticodon arms of the two tRNAs are sufficiently close to interact with adjacent codons in mRNA.

The emergence of electronic publishing has created opportunities to increase the range of formats available for conveying scientific content. We introduce the Graphical Explanation Markup Language, GEML, implemented as an XML format for defining molecular documentaries which exploit the interactive capabilities of electronic publishing. GEML builds upon existing molecular structure definitions such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) standard file format. GEML provides a library of gestures (or actions) commonly used for structural explanations, and is extensible. XML allows us to separate explicit statements about how to highlight a molecular structure from the implementation of these instructions. We also present GEIS (Generator of Explanatory Interactive Systems), a program that takes as input a GEML documentary definition file and produces all the files necessary for an interactive, web-based molecular documentary. To demonstrate GEML and GEIS, we constructed a documentary capturing the difficult 3D notions expressed in two selected published reports about human topoisomerase I. We have created a prototype Java application, GEMLBuilder, as an editor of GEML files.

Accurate detection of this sequence can be used as a fingerprint for individual strains, but can be difficult because of noisy data. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric discriminant analysis method for predicting the locations of the IS6110 sequence from microarray data. Polymerase chain reaction extension products generated from primers specific for the insertion sequence are hybridized to a microarray containing targets corresponding to each open reading frame in M. tb. To test for insertion sites, we use microarray intensity values extracted from small windows of contiguous open reading frames. Rank-transformation of spot intensities and first-order differences in local windows provide enough information to reliably determine the presence of an insertion sequence. The nonparametric approach outperforms all other methods tested in this study.

It is often not clear whether a set of experiments are measuring fundamentally different gene expression states or are measuring similar states created through different mechanisms. It is useful, therefore, to define a core set of independent features for the expression states that allow them to be compared directly. Principal components analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique for determining the key variables in a multidimensional data set that explain the differences in the observations, and can be used to simplify the analysis and visualization of multidimensional data sets. We show that application of PCA to expression data (where the experimental conditions are the variables, and the gene expression measurements are the observations) allows us to summarize the ways in which gene responses vary under different conditions. Examination of the components also provides insight into the underlying factors that are measured in the experiments. We applied PCA to the publicly released yeast sporulation data set (Chu et al. 1998). In that work, 7 different measurements of gene expression were made over time. PCA on the time-points suggests that much of the observed variability in the experiment can be summarized in just 2 components--i.e. 2 variables capture most of the information. These components appear to represent (1) overall induction level and (2) change in induction level over time. We also examined the clusters proposed in the original paper, and show how they are manifested in principal component space.

The authors call these discrepancies data-model conflicts. They have built a prototype system to help scientists resolve these conflicts in a more systematic, evidence-based manner. In computational biology, data-model conflicts are the result of complex computations in which data and models are transformed and evaluated. Increasingly, the data, models, and tools employed in these computations come from diverse and distributed resources, contributing to a widening gap between the scientist and the original context in which these resources were produced. This contextual rift can contribute to the misuse of scientific data or tools and amplifies the problem of diagnosing data-model conflicts. The authors' hypothesis is that systematic collection of metadata about a computational process can help bridge the contextual rift and provide information for supporting automated diagnosis of these conflicts. The methodology involves three major steps. First, the authors decompose the data-model evaluation process into abstract functional components. Next, they use this process decomposition to enumerate the possible causes of the data-model conflict and direct the acquisition of diagnostically relevant metadata. Finally, they use evidence statically and dynamically generated from the metadata collected to identify the most likely causes of the given conflict. They describe how these methods are implemented in a knowledge-based system called GRENDEL and show how GRENDEL can be used to help diagnose conflicts between experimental data and computationally built structural models of the 30S ribosomal subunit.

We have studied the ability of computed models to preserve the microenvironments of functional sites. In particular, 653 model structures of a calcium-binding protein (generated using an ab initio folding protocol) were analyzed, and the degree to which calcium-binding sites were recognizable was assessed.While some model structures preserve the calcium-binding microenvironments, many others, including some with low root mean square deviations (rmsds) from the crystal structure of the native protein, do not. There is a very weak correlation between the overall rmsd of a structure and the preservation of calcium-binding sites. Only when the quality of the model structure is high (rmsd less than 2 A for atoms in the 7 A local neighborhood around calcium) does the modeling of the binding sites become reliable.Protein structure prediction methods need to be assessed in terms of their preservation of functional sites. High-resolution structures are necessary for identifying binding sites such as calcium-binding sites. View details for Web of Science ID 000080967100007 View details for PubMedID 10404593 Until ab initio structure prediction methods are perfected, the estimation of structure for protein molecules will depend on combining multiple sources of experimental and theoretical data. Secondary structure predictions are a particularly useful source of structural information, but are currently only approximately 70% correct, on average. Structure computation algorithms which incorporate secondary structure information must therefore have methods for dealing with predictions that are imperfect. EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED: We have modified our algorithm for probabilistic least squares structural computations to accept 'disjunctive' constraints, in which a constraint is provided as a set of possible values, each weighted with a probability. Thus, when a helix is predicted, the distances associated with a helix are given most of the weight, but some weights can be allocated to the other possibilities (strand and coil). We have tested a variety of strategies for this weighting scheme in conjunction with a baseline synthetic set of sparse distance data, and compared it with strategies which do not use disjunctive constraints.Naive interpretations in which predictions were taken as 100% correct led to poor-quality structures. Interpretations that allow disjunctive constraints are quite robust, and even relatively poor predictions (58% correct) can significantly increase the quality of computed structures (almost halving the RMS error from the known structure).Secondary structure predictions can be used to improve the quality of three-dimensional structural computations. In fact, when interpreted appropriately, imperfect predictions can provide almost as much improvement as perfect predictions in three-dimensional structure calculations.

For large molecular ensembles with multiple protein and nucleic acid components, the problem of maintaining tractability in structural computations becomes critical. A well-known strategy for solving difficult problems is divide-and-conquer. For molecular computations, there are two ways in which problems can be divided: (1) using the natural hierarchy within biological macromolecules (taking advantage of primary sequence, secondary structural subunits and tertiary structural motifs, when they are known); and (2) using the hierarchy that results from analyzing the distribution of structural constraints (providing information about which substructures are constrained to one another). In this paper, we show that these two hierarchies can be complementary and can provide information for efficient decomposition of structural computations. We demonstrate five methods for building such hierarchies--two automated heuristics that use both natural and empirical hierarchies, one knowledge-based process using both hierarchies, one method based on the natural hierarchy alone, and for completeness one random hierarchy oblivious to auxiliary information--and apply them to a data set for the procaryotic 30S ribosomal subunit using our probabilistic least squares structure estimation algorithm. We show that the three methods that combine natural hierarchies with empirical hierarchies create decompositions which increase the efficiency of computations by as much as 50-fold. There is only half this gain when using the natural decomposition alone, while the random hierarchy suggests that a speedup of about five can be expected just by virtue of having a decomposition. Although the knowledge-based method performs marginally better, the automatic heuristics are easier to use, scale more reliably to larger problems, and can match the performance of knowledge-based methods if provided with basic structural information.

The first is the flow of genetic information from the DNA of an individual organism up to the characteristics of a population of such organisms (with an eventual passage of information back to the genetic pool, as encoded within DNA). The second is the flow of experimental information from observed biological phenomena to models that explain them, and then to new experiments in order to test these models. The discipline of bioinformatics has its roots in a number of activities, including the organization of DNA sequence and protein three-dimensional structural data collections in the 1960's and 1970's. It has become a booming academic and industrial enterprise with the introduction of biological experiments that rapidly produce massive amounts of data (such as the multiple genome sequencing projects, the large scale analysis of gene expression, and the large scale analysis of protein-protein interactions). Basic biological science has always had an impact on clinical medicine (and clinical medical information systems), and is creating a new generation of epidemiologic, diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment modalities. Bioinformatics efforts that appear to be wholly geared towards basic science are likely to become relevant to clinical informatics in the coming decade. For example, DNA sequence information and sequence annotations will appear in the medical chart with increasing frequency. The algorithms developed for research in bioinformatics will soon become part of clinical information systems.

These bibliographies may be broad and inclusive, or focused and precise in their inclusion criteria. In either case, the task of maintaining a complete bibliography within a particular area of research is made difficult by the diversity, complexity and huge volume of newly published literature. In an effort to effectively and automatically retrieve relevant literature, different search strategies and indexing tools have been developed, including the RELATED ARTICLES function provided with the PubMed system. In this paper, we report a program for incremental updates of a bibliography using the PubMed RELATED ARTICLES function. Given a highly specialized starting bibliography of experimental measurements of the structure of the 30S bacterial ribosomal subunit, the system was applied to find additional relevant references. For this particular task, the system has a recall of 75%, a strict precision of 32% and a partial precision of 42%. Our results are notable because although the RELATED ARTICLES function is purely statistical, it is nonetheless able to select a very narrowly defined set of articles from the literature.

For some types of information, such as distances between atoms, numerous methods are available for computing structures that satisfy the provided constraints. It is more difficult, however, to use information about the degree to which an atom is on the surface or buried as a useful constraint during structure computations. Surface measures have been used as accept/reject criteria for previously computed structures, but this is not an efficient strategy. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of applying a surface measure in the computation of molecular structure, using a method of probabilistic least square computations which facilitates the introduction of multiple, noisy, heterogeneous data sources. For this purpose, we introduce a simple purely geometrical measure of surface proximity called maximal conic view (MCV). MCV is efficiently computable and differentiable, and is hence well suited to driving a structural optimization method based, in part, on surface data. As an initial validation, we show that MCV correlates well with known measures for total exposed surface area. We use this measure in our experiments to show that information about surface proximity (derived from theory or experiment, for example) can be added to a set of distance measurements to increase significantly the quality of the computed structure. In particular, when 30 to 50 percent of all possible short-range distances are provided, the addition of surface information improves the quality of the computed structure (as measured by RMS fit) by as much as 80 percent. Our results demonstrate that knowledge of which atoms are on the surface and which are buried can be used as a powerful constraint in estimating molecular structure.

Most existing web data resources organize their information either in structured flat files or relational databases with basic retrieval capabilities. For databases with one or a few simple relations, these approaches are successful, but they can be cumbersome when there is a data model involving multiple relations between complex data. We believe that knowledge-based resources offer a solution in these cases. Knowledge bases have explicit declarations of the concepts in the domain, along with the relations between them. They are usually organized hierarchically, and provide a global data model with a controlled vocabulary. We have created the OWEB architecture for building online scientific data resources using knowledge bases. OWEB provides a shell for structuring data, providing secure and shared access, and creating computational modules for processing and displaying data. In this paper, we describe the translation of the online immunological database MHCPEP into an OWEB system called MHCWeb. This effort involved building a conceptual model for the data, creating a controlled terminology for the legal values for different types of data, and then translating the original data into the new structure. The OWEB environment allows for flexible access to the data by both users and computer programs. View details for Web of Science ID 000171768600185 View details for PubMedID 9929358 We have developed a new method for recognizing sites in three-dimensional protein structures. Our method is based on our previously reported algorithm for creating descriptions of protein microenvironments using physical and chemical properties at multiple levels of detail (including features at the atomic, chemical group, residue, and secondary structural levels). The recognition method takes three inputs: a set of sites that share some structural or functional role, a set of control nonsites that lack this role, and a single query site. The values of properties for the query site are compared to the distributions of values for both sites and nonsites to determine the group to which it is most similar. A log-odds scoring function, based on Bayes' Rule, computes a score that indicates the likelihood that the query region is a site of interest. In this paper, we apply the method to the task of identifying calcium binding sites in proteins. Cross-validation analysis shows that this recognition approach has high sensitivity and specificity. We also describe the results of scanning four calcium binding proteins (with the calcium removed) using a three-dimensional grid of probe points at 2 A spacing. The probe points that have high scores cluster around the true calcium binding sites, with the highest scoring points at or near the binding sites. The method fails in only one case where a calcium binding site is created by four proteins in the crystal lattice, and is thus not recognizable within the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Our results show that property-based descriptions can be used for recognizing protein sites in unannotated structures.

Medical informatics is the study of the concepts and conceptual relationships within biomedical information and how they can be harnessed for practical applications. In the past decade, the field has exploded as health professionals recognize the importance of strategic information management and the inadequacies of traditional tools for information storage, retrieval, and analysis. At the same time that medical informatics has established a presence within many academic and industrial research facilities, its goals and methods have become less clear to practicing physicians. In this article, I outline 10 challenges in medical informatics that provide a framework for understanding developments in the field. These challenges have been divided into those relating to infrastructure, specific performance, and evaluation. The primary goals of medical informatics, as for any other branch of biomedical research, are to improve the overall health of patients by combining basic scientific and engineering insights with the useful application of these insights to important problems.

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) currently contains nearly 5,000 entries and is growing exponentially. Most new structures are similar structurally to ones reported previously and can be grouped into families. As the number of members in each family increases, it becomes possible to summarize, statistically, the commonalities and differences within each family. We reported previously a method for finding the atoms in a family alignment that have low spatial variance and those that have higher spatial variance (i.e., the \"core\" atoms that have the same relative position in all family members and the \"non-core\" atoms that do not). The core structures we compute have biological significance and provide an excellent quantitative and visual summary of a multiple structural alignment. In order to extend their utility, we have constructed a library of protein family cores, accessible over the World Wide Web at http:/ /www-smi.stanford.edu/projects/helix/LPFC/. This library is generated automatically with publicly available computer programs requiring only a set of multiple alignments as input. It contains quantitative analysis of the spatial variation of atoms within each protein family, the coordinates of the average core structures derived from the families, and display files (in bitmap and VRML formats). Here, we describe the resource and illustrate its applicability by comparing three multiple alignments of the globin family. These three alignments are found to be similar, but with some significant differences related to the diversity of family members and the specific method used for alignment.

The mode of interaction between biologists and on-line information resources, however, has been mostly limited to simple interface technologies such has hypertext links, tables and forms. The introduction of platform-independent runtime environments facilitates the development of more sophisticated WWW-based user interfaces. Until recently, most such interfaces have been tightly coupled to the underlying computation engines, and not separated as reusable components. We believe that many subdisciplines of biology have intuitive and familiar graphical representations of knowledge that can serve as multipurpose user interface elements. We call such graphical idioms \"domain graphics\". In order to illustrate the power of such graphics, we have built a reusable interface based on the standard two dimensional (2D) layout of RNA secondary structure. The interface can be used to represent any pre-computed layout of RNA, and takes as a parameters the sets of actions to be performed as a user interacts with the interface. It can provide to any associated application program information about the base, helix, or subsequence selected by the user. We show the versatility of this interface by using it as a special purpose interface to BLAST, Medline and the RNA MFOLD search/compute engines.

The KB is designed to support the construction of 3D models of the 30S subunit, as well as the analysis and extension of relevant functional and phylogenetic information. Most published information about the structure of the ubiquitous ribosome focuses on E. coli as a model system. At the same time, thousands of RNA sequences for the ribosome have been gathered and cataloged. The volume and complexity of these data can complicate attempts to separate structural data peculiar to E. coli from data of universal relevance. We have written an application that dynamically queries the KB and the Ribosome Database Project, a repository of ribosomal RNA sequences from other organisms, in order to assess the relevance of structural data to particular organisms. The application uses the RDP alignment to determine whether a set of data refer primarily to conserved, mismatched, or gapped positions. For a set of 16 representative articles evaluated over 211 sequences, 73% of observations have unambiguous translations from E. coli to the other organisms, 21% have somewhat ambiguous translations, and 6% have no translations. There is a wide variation in these numbers over different articles and organisms, confirming that some articles report structural information specific to E. coli while others report information that is quite general.

It offers an additional opportunity, however, to support distributed computation and sharing of results. Currently, computational analysis tools are often separated from the data in a manner that makes iterative hypothesis testing cumbersome. We hypothesize that the cycle of scientific reasoning (using data to build models, and evaluating models in light of data) can be facilitated with resources that link computations with semantic models of the data. Riboweb is an on-line knowledge-based resource that supports the creation of three-dimensional models of the 30S ribosomal subunit. It has three components: (I) a knowledge base containing representations of the essential physical components and published structural data, (II) computational modules that use the knowledge base to build or analyze structural models, and (III) a web-based user interface that supports multiple users, sessions and computations. We have built a prototype of Riboweb, and have used it to refine a rough model of the central domain of the 30S subunit from E. coli. procedure. Our results suggest that sophisticated and integrated computational capabilities can be delivered to biologists using this simple three-component architecture.

Our analysis includes comparison of amino acid environments with random control environments as well as with each of the other amino acid environments. We describe the amino acid environments with a set of 21 features summarizing atomic, chemical group, residue, and secondary structural features. The environments are divided into radial shells of 1 A thickness to represent the distance of the features from the amino acid C beta atoms. We make the results of our analysis available graphically over the world wide web. To illustrate the validity and utility of our analysis, we used the amino acid comparative profiles to construct a substitution matrix, the WAC matrix, based on a simple summary of the computed environmental differences. We compared our matrix to BLOSUM62 and PAM250 in BLAST searches with query sequences selected from 39 protein families found in the PROSITE database. Although BLOSUM62 was the most sensitive matrix overall, our matrix was more sensitive for some families, and exhibited overall performance similar to PAM250. Our results suggest that the radial distribution of biochemical and biophysical features is useful for comparing amino acid environments, and that similarity matrices based on the geometric distribution of features around amino acids may produce improved search sensitivity.

These models have been based for the most part on independent data sets and different sets of modeling assumptions. In order to evaluate such models meaningfully, methods are required to explicitly model the spatial certainty with which individual structural components are positioned by specific data sets. In this report, we use a constraint satisfaction algorithm to explicitly assess the location of the secondary structural elements of the 16S RNA, as well as the certainty with which these elements can be positioned. The algorithm initially assumes that these helical elements can occupy any position and orientation and then systematically eliminates those positions and orientations that do not satisfy formally parameterized interpretations of structural constraints. Using a conservative interpretation of the hydroxyl radical footprinting data, the positions of the ribosomal proteins as defined by neutron diffraction studies, and the secondary structure of 16S rRNA, the location of the RNA secondary structural elements can be defined with an average precision of 25 A (ranging from 12.8 to 56.3 A). The uncertainty in individual helix positions is both heterogeneous and dependent upon the number of constraints imposed on the helix. The topology of the resulting model is consistent with previous models based on independent approaches. The result of our computation is a conservative upper bound on the possible positions of the RNA secondary structural elements allowed by this data set, and provides a suitable starting point for refinement with other sources of data or different sets of modeling assumptions. View details for Web of Science ID A1996VH69500001 View details for PubMedID 8809013 The problem of computing a molecular structure from a set of distances arises in the interpretation of NMR data as well as other experimental methods that yield distance information. Techniques for computing structures must find conformations consistent with the distance data. There are often other constraints on the structure that must be satisfied as well. One of the most problematic constraints is the constraint on the total volume occupied by the atoms. In this paper, we use the first two moments (mean and variance) of an estimated distance distribution to constrain the volume of a computed structure. We show that a probabilistic algorithm for matching the first two moments of the estimated distance distribution significantly improves the quality of the solution, especially when the distance information alone is not sufficient to define the structure precisely. We also show that our method is not sensitive to small errors in the estimates of mean and variance of the distance distribution. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this constraint in computing a low-resolution structure of the 30S prokaryotic ribosomal subunit. Quantitative analysis of our results allows us to assess the information content contained in constraints on volume, and to show that in some cases addition of a volume constraint adds information roughly equivalent to doubling the number of input distances. Our results also demonstrate the flexibility of probabilistic representations of structural constraints, and the importance of including volume information to constrain structural computations-especially in the case of sparse data.

It is not clear, though, the degree to which these protease families share common biochemical and biophysical properties. We have used a computer program to study the properties that are shared by four serine protease active sites with no overall structural or sequence homology. The program systematically compares the region around the catalytic histidines from the four proteins with a set of noncatalytic histidines, used as controls. It reports the three-dimensional locations and level of statistical significance for those properties that distinguish the catalytic histidines from the noncatalytic ones. The method of analysis is general and can be applied easily to other active sites of interest.As expected, some of the reported properties correspond to previously known features of the serine protease active site, including the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole. Novel properties are also found, including the spatial distribution of charged, polar, and hydrophobic groups arranged to stabilize the catalytic residues, and a relative abundance of some residues (Val, Tyr, Leu, and Gly) around the active site.Our findings show that in addition to some properties common to all the proteases examined, there are a set of preferred, but not required, properties that can be reliably observed only by aligning the sites and comparing them with carefully selected statistical controls.

First, we want to provide a technical introduction for computer science and medical information science students to the challenges of computing with molecular biology data, particularly the advantages of having easy access to real-world data sets. Second, we want to equip the students with the skills required of productive research assistants in molecular biology computing research projects. Finally, we want to provide a showcase for local investigators to describe their work in the context of a course that provide adequate background information. In order to achieve these goals, we have created a programming course, in which three major projects and six smaller assignments are assigned during the quarter. We stress fundamental representations and algorithms during the first part of the course in lectures given by the core faculty, and then have more focused lectures in which faculty research interests are highlighted. The course stressed issues of structural molecular biology, in order to better motivate the critical issues in sequence analysis. The culmination of the course was a challenge to the students to use a version of protein threading to predict which members of a set of unknown sequences were globins. The course was well received, and has been made a core requirement in the Medical Information Sciences program. View details for PubMedID 9390224 Tracking individual web sessions provides valuable information about user behavior. This information can be used for general purpose evaluation of web-based user interfaces to biomedical information systems. To this end, we have developed Lamprey, a tool for doing quantitative and qualitative analysis of Web-based user interfaces. Lamprey can be used from any conforming browser, and does not require modification of server or client software. By rerouting WWW navigation through a centralized filter, Lamprey collects the sequence and timing of hyperlinks used by individual users to move through the web. Instead of providing marginal statistics, it retains the full information required to recreate a user session. We have built Lamprey as a standard Common Gateway Interface (CGI) that works with all standard WWW browsers and servers. In this paper, we describe Lamprey and provide a short demonstration of this approach for evaluating web usage patterns.

The TransFER model provides a mechanism to automatically customize database queries based on a reference schema of clinical data and an encoded set of database mappings. In this paper, we describe the elements of the TransFER model and we present the results of a formal evaluation we conducted to assess the utility and generality of the model. The results suggest that the TransFER has significant potential for automating query translation and facilitating application sharing, but that further work on the representation of temporal semantics, on the modeling of missing data, and on the optimization of complex queries is required. View details for PubMedID 8947710 As the database of three-dimensional protein structures expands, it becomes possible to classify related structures into families. Some of these families, such as the globins, have enough members to allow statistical analysis of conserved features. Previously, we have shown that a probabilistic representation based on means and variances can be useful for defining structural cores for large families. These cores contain the subset of atoms that are in essentially the same relative positions in all members of the family. In addition to defining a core, our method creates an ordered list of atoms, ranked by their structural variation. In applying our core-finding procedure to the globins, we find that helices A, B, G and H form a structural core with low variance. These helices fold early in the folding pathway, and superimpose well with helices in the helix-turn-helix repressor protein family. The non-core helices (F and the parts of other helices that interact with it) are associated with the functional differences among the globins, and are encoded within a separate exon. We have also compared the variability measure implicit in our core structures with measures of sequence variability, using a procedure for measuring sequence variability that helps correct for the biased sampling in the databanks. We find, somewhat surprisingly, that sequence variation does not appear to correlate with structural variation. View details for Web of Science ID A1995TR87100009 View details for PubMedID 8808580 A variety of methods are currently available for creating multiple alignments, and these can be used to define and characterize families of related proteins, such as the globins or the immunoglobulins. We have developed a method for using a multiple alignment to identify an average structural \"core\", a subset of atoms with low structural variation. We show how the means and variances of core-atom positions summarize the commonalities and differences with a family, making them particularly useful in compiling libraries of protein folds. We show further how it is possible to describe the rotation and translation relating two core structures, as in two domains of a multi-domain protein, in a consistent fashion in terms of a \"mean\" transformation and a deviation about this mean. Once determined, our average core structures (with their implicit measure of structural variation) allow us to define a measure of structural similarity more informative than the usual root-mean-square (RMS) deviation in atomic position, i.e. a \"better RMS.\" Our average structures also permit straightforward comparisons between variation in structure and sequence at each position in a family. We have applied our core-finding methodology in detail to the immunoglobulin family. We find that the structural variability we observe just within the VL and VH domains anticipates the variability that others have observed throughout the whole immunoglobulin superfamily; that a core definition based on sequence conservation, somewhat surprisingly, does not agree with one based on structural similarity; and that the cores of the VL and VH domains vary about 5 degrees in relative orientation across the known structures.

Structures are displayed in terms of perfect points, spheres, and lines with no uncertainty. However, all experimental methods for defining structures, and many methods for predicting and comparing structures, associate uncertainties with each atomic coordinate. We have developed graphical representations that highlight these uncertainties. These representations are encapsulated in a new interactive display program, PROTEAND. PROTEAND represents structural uncertainty in three ways: (1) The traditional way: The program shows a collection of structures as superposed and overlapped stick-figure models. (2) Ellipsoids: At each atom position, the program shows an ellipsoid derived from a three-dimensional Gaussian model of uncertainty. This probabilistic model provides additional information about the relationship between atoms that can be displayed as a correlation matrix. (3) Rigid-body volumes: Using clouds of dots, the program can show the range of rigid-body motion of selected substructures, such as individual alpha helices. We illustrate the utility of these display modalities by the applying PROTEAND to the globin family of proteins, and show that certain types of structural variation are best illustrated with different methods of display.

A site can be defined by a three-dimensional location and a local neighborhood around this location in which the structure or function exists. We have developed a computer system to facilitate structural analysis (both qualitative and quantitative) of biomolecular sites. Our system automatically examines the spatial distributions of biophysical and biochemical properties, and reports those regions within a site where the distribution of these properties differs significantly from control nonsites. The properties range from simple atom-based characteristics such as charge to polypeptide-based characteristics such as type of secondary structure. Our analysis of sites uses non-sites as controls, providing a baseline for the quantitative assessment of the significance of the features that are uncovered. In this paper, we use radial distributions of properties to study three well-known sites (the binding sites for calcium, the milieu of disulfide bridges, and the serine protease active site). We demonstrate that the system automatically finds many of the previously described features of these sites and augments these features with some new details. In some cases, we cannot confirm the statistical significance of previously reported features. Our results demonstrate that analysis of protein structure is sensitive to assumptions about background distributions, and that these distributions should be considered explicitly during structural analyses. View details for Web of Science ID A1995QU44000004 View details for PubMedID 7613462 A protein site is a region of a three-dimensional protein structure with a distinguishing functional or structural role. Certain sites recur in different protein structures (for example catalytic sites, calcium binding sites, and some types of turns), but maintain critical shared features. To facilitate the analysis of such protein sites, we have developed a computer system for analyzing the spatial distributions of biochemical properties around a site. The system takes a set of similar sites and a set of control nonsites, and finds differences between them. Specifically, it compares distributions of the properties surrounding the sites with those surrounding the nonsites, and reports statistically significant differences. In this paper, we use our method to analyze the features in the active site of the serine protease enzymes. We compare the use of radial distributions (shells) with 3-D grids (blocks) in the analysis of the active site. We demonstrate three different strategies for focusing attention on significant findings, based on properties of interest, spatial volumes of interest, and on the level of statistical significance. Finally, we show that the program automatically identifies conserved sequential, secondary structural and biophysical features of the serine protease active site, using noncatalytic histidine residues as a control environment. View details for PubMedID 7584427 View details for Web of Science ID A1995BD19R00076 We present a procedure for automatically identifying from a set of aligned protein structures a subset of atoms with only a small amount of structural variation, i.e., a core. We apply this procedure to the globin family of proteins. Based purely on the results of the procedure, we show that the globin fold can be divided into two parts. The part with greater structural variation consists of the residues near the heme (the F helix and parts of the G and H helices), and the part with lesser structural variation (the core) forms a structural framework similar to that of the repressor protein (A, B, and E helices and remainder of the G and H helices). Such a division is consistent with many other structural and biochemical findings. In addition, we find further partitions within the core that may have biological significance. Finally, using the structural core of the globin family as a reference point, we have compared structural variation to sequence variation and shown that a core definition based on sequence conservation does not necessarily agree with one based on structural similarity.

For example, they often provide a single solution which is difficult to explain, or which can not be incrementally modified using secondary \"soft\" constrains that are difficult to encode within the optimization. In order to address these issues, we have developed a probabilistic optimization technique that allows the user to enter prior probability distributions (Gaussian) for the parameters to be optimized as well as for the constraints on the parameters. Our technique combines the prior distributions with the constraints using Bayes' rule. The algorithm produces not only a set of parameter values, but variances on these values and covariances showing the correlations between parameters. We have applied this method to the problem of planning a radiosurgical ablation of brain tumors. The radiation plan should maximize dose to tumor, minimize dose to surrounding areas, and provide an even distribution of dosage across the tumor. It also should be explainable to and modifiable by the expert physicians based on external considerations. We have compared the results of our method with the standard linear programming approach.

With the increasing prevalence of computer systems in health care, an increasing amount of medical record text will be stored electronically. However, for such textual documents to be indexed, shared, and processed adequately by computers, it will be important to be able to identify concepts in the documents using a common medical terminology. Automated methods for extracting concepts in a standard terminology would enhance retrieval and analysis of medical record data. This paper discusses a method for extracting concepts from medical record documents using the medical terminology SNOMED-III (Systematized Nomenclature of Human and Veterinary Medicine, Version III). The technique employs a linear least squares fit that maps training set phrases to SNOMED concepts. This mapping can be used for unknown text inputs in the same domain as the training set to predict SNOMED concepts that are contained in the document. We have implemented the method in the domain of congestive heart failure for history and physical exam texts. Our system has a reasonable response time. We tested the system over a range of thresholds. The system performed with 90% sensitivity and 83% specificity at the lowest threshold, and 42% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity at the highest threshold.

These complexes, consisting of multiple protein and/or nucleic acid components, can contain many thousands of atoms and the experimental techniques used to study them provide relatively sparse structural information with significant measurement uncertainty. Computational technologies are required to reduce the conformational search space and synthesize the data in order to produce the structures or (more usually) sets of structures compatible with the data. In this paper, we show that a method based on the constraint satisfaction paradigm produces a three-dimensional topology for the central domain of the 16S ribosomal RNA that is generally consistent with interactively built models, although differing in significant ways. The modeling incorporates information about secondary structure of the nucleic acid, neutron diffraction data about the relative positions and uncertainties of the proteins, and protection experiments indicating proximities of segments of RNA to specific protein subunits. Unlike previously proposed models, our model contains explicit information about the range of positions for each subunit that are compatible with the data. The system uses a grid search, checks distances in a direction-dependent manner, uses disjunctive distance constraints, and checks for volume overlap violations. View details for PubMedID 7584378 Many clinical decision-support applications are created in a centralized manner, but distributed widely for local use. When such applications include queries to electronic patient databases, the queries must be translated to conform to local database specifications. Because no well-defined standard model of clinical data exists, the translation process is ad hoc, costly, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an abstract formalism, called the Standard Query Model Framework, for specifying a standard clinical data model and for supporting the automated and reliable translation of queries that appear in shared decision-support applications. We present the components of this framework, discuss their desirable features, and describe a prototype that we have developed for relational patient databases.

In our university-based internal medicine clinic, we have studied attitudes toward and access to e-mail among patients. A survey of 444 patients in our clinic showed that 46% of patients in the clinic use e-mail, and 89% of those with e-mail use it at work. Fifty-one percent would use e-mail all or most of the time to communicate with the clinic if it were available, and many of the communications that currently take place by phone could be replaced by e-mail. Barriers to e-mail use include privacy concerns among patients who use e-mail in the workplace, choosing the appropriate tasks for e-mail, and methods for efficiently triaging electronic messages in the clinic.

Many biomedical problems involve the elucidation of structure (for example, from experimental data or from imaging studies), and structural models can often drive the process of inferring precise structure from data. Ideally, model-driven data interpretation combines knowledge about the generic features of a class of biological structures (as contained within a model) with data that provide specific information (often noisy) about a particular instance of the class. In this paper we briefly discuss model-driven determination of biological structure as an example of a structural constraint satisfaction problem. We describe a probabilistic implementation of structural constraint satisfaction, and show that our formulation of a particular organ modeling technology (Radial Contour Models) exhibits promising performance. Our results demonstrate the utility of probabilistic models for the solution of structural constraint satisfaction problems. View details for PubMedID 8130522 Algorithms based on probability theory can address issues of uncertainty directly through their representational framework and their theory for data combination. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of probabilistic formulations for molecular-structure calculations, describe one implementation of such a formulation, and show its performance on a data set derived from analysis of the statistical correlations within a set of aligned transfer RNA sequences. By assigning reasonable physical interpretations to certain statistical correlations, we are able to calculate three-dimensional structures for tRNA from a random starting structure. The constraints that we use are associated with different variances, and so their effects are not uniform, and must be reconciled by a probabilistic algorithm to yield the most likely structure. As might be predicted, the uncertainty in the position for each base is a function of both the number and strength of the constraints, and is reflected in the variances in atomic position calculated by the algorithm. For example, the hinge region in the tRNA is shown to be the most uncertain. In addition, the algorithm retains information about positional covariation that is useful for understanding the relationships between different parts of the structure. These experiments also demonstrate that we can define a single-sphere representation for each base that is useful for nucleic acid structural calculations in the same way that alpha-carbon representations are useful for protein structural calculations. View details for PubMedID 7584327 View details for Web of Science ID A1993LP80900004 We have systematically examined how the quality of NMR protein structures depends on (1) the number of NOE distance constraints, (2) their assumed precision, (3) the method of structure calculation and (4) the size of the protein. The test sets of distance constraints have been derived from the crystal structures of crambin (5 kDa) and staphylococcal nuclease (17 kDa). Three methods of structure calculation have been compared: Distance Geometry (DGEOM), Restrained Molecular Dynamics (XPLOR) and the Double Iterated Kalman Filter (DIKF). All three methods can reproduce the general features of the starting structure under all conditions tested. In many instances the apparent precision of the calculated structure (as measured by the RMS dispersion from the average) is greater than its accuracy (as measured by the RMS deviation of the average structure from the starting crystal structure). The global RMS deviations from the reference structures decrease exponentially as the number of constraints is increased, and after using about 30% of all potential constraints, the errors asymptotically approach a limiting value. Increasing the assumed precision of the constraints has the same qualitative effect as increasing the number of constraints. For comparable numbers of constraints/residue, the precision of the calculated structure is less for the larger than for the smaller protein, regardless of the method of calculation. The accuracy of the average structure calculated by Restrained Molecular Dynamics is greater than that of structures obtained by purely geometric methods (DGEOM and DIKF). View details for Web of Science ID A1992JF96900006 View details for PubMedID 1511237 We have determined the solution structures and examined the dynamics of the Escherichia coli trp repressor (a 25-kDa dimer), with and without the co-repressor L-tryptophan, from NMR data. This is the largest protein structure thus far determined by NMR. To obtain a set of data sufficient for a structure determination it was essential to resort to isotopic spectral editing. Line broadening observed in this molecular mass range precludes for the most part the measurement of coupling constants and stereospecific assignments, with the inevitable result that the attainable resolution of the final structure will be somewhat lower than the resolution reported for smaller proteins and peptides. Nevertheless the general topology of the protein can be deduced from the subsets of NOEs defining the secondary and tertiary structure, providing a basis for further refinement using the full set of NOEs and energy minimization. We report here (a) an intermediate resolution structure that can be deduced from NMR data, covalent, angular and van-der-Waals constraints only, without resort to detailed energy calculations, and (b) the limits of uncertainty within which this structure is valid. An examination of these structures combined with backbone amide exchange data shows that even at this resolution three important conclusions can be drawn: (a) the protein structure changes upon binding tryptophan; (b) the putative DNA binding region is much more flexible than the core of the molecule, with backbone amide proton exchange rates 1000 times faster than in the core; (c) the binding of tryptophan stabilizes the repressor molecule, which is reflected in both the appearance of additional NOEs, and in the slowing of backbone proton exchange rates by factors of 3-10. Sequence-specific 1H-NMR assignments and the secondary structure of the holopressor (L-tryptophan-bound form) have been reported previously [C. H. Arrowsmith, R. Pachter, R. B. Altman, S. B. Iyer & O. Jardetzky (1990) Biochemistry 29, 6332-6341]. Those for the trp aporepressor (L-tryptophan-free form), made using the same methods and conditions as described in the cited paper, are reported here. The secondary structure of the aporepressor was calculated from sequential and medium-range NOEs and is the same as reported for the holorepressor except that helix E is shorter. The tertiary solution structures for both forms of the repressor were calculated from long-range NOE data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) View details for Web of Science ID A1991GP84100006 View details for PubMedID 1935980 View details for Web of Science ID A1991FJ10000002 View details for Web of Science ID A1991BV14N00028 Sequence-specific 1H NMR assignments are reported for the active L-tryptophan-bound form of Escherichia coli trp repressor. The repressor is a symmetric dimer of 107 residues per monomer; thus at 25 kDa, this is the largest protein for which such detailed sequence-specific assignments have been made. At this molecular mass the broad line widths of the NMR resonances preclude the use of assignment methods based on 1H-1H scalar coupling. Our assignment strategy centers on two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY) of a series of selectively deuterated repressor analogues. A new methodology was developed for analysis of the spectra on the basis of the effects of selective deuteration on cross-peak intensities in the NOESY spectra. A total of 90% of the backbone amide protons have been assigned, and 70% of the alpha and side-chain proton resonances are assigned. The local secondary structure was calculated from sequential and medium-range backbone NOEs with the double-iterated Kalman filter method [Altman, R. B., & Jardetzky, O. (1989) Methods Enzymol. 177, 218-246]. The secondary structure agrees with that of the crystal structure [Schevitz, R., Otwinowski, Z., Joachimiak, A., Lawson, C. L., & Sigler, P. B. (1985) Nature 317, 782], except that the solution state is somewhat more disordered in the DNA binding region and in the N-terminal region of the first alpha-helix. Since the repressor is a symmetric dimer, long-range intersubunit NOEs were distinguished from intrasubunit interactions by formation of heterodimers between two appropriate selectively deuterated proteins and comparison of the resulting NOESY spectrum with that of each selectively deuterated homodimer. Thus, from spectra of three heterodimers, long-range NOEs between eight pairs of residues were identified as intersubunit NOEs, and two additional long-range intrasubunits NOEs were assigned.

Starting with all possible conformations, the method systematically excludes conformations until the remaining structures are only those compatible with the data. The apparent computational intractability of this approach is reduced by assembling the protein in pieces, by considering the protein at several levels of abstraction, by utilizing constraint satisfaction methods to consider only a few atoms at a time, and by utilizing artificial intelligence methods of heuristic control to decide which actions will exclude the most conformations. Example results are presented for simulated NMR data from the known crystal structure of cytochrome b562 (103 residues). For 10 sample backbones an average root-mean-square deviation from the crystal of 4.1 A was found for all alpha-carbon atoms and 2.8 A for helix alpha-carbons alone. The 10 backbones define the family of all structures compatible with the data and provide nearly correct starting structures for adjustment by any of the current structure determination methods.

The PROTEAN system defines protein topology on the basis of experimental data alone. Its performance on three data sets, derived from the lac-repressor headpiece of E. coli, sperm whale myoglobin, and domain 1 of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, indicates that there may be families of related conformations that are consistent with the experimental data. These conformations provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses in the data sets. They also provide a set of structures with which to begin theoretical refinements. We outline here a strategy which maintains a clear distinction between refinements based on theory and those based on experiment, and thus allows a careful analysis of the properties of such refinement methods.

    "bio": "Our goal is to develop and clinically implement new technologies for high-precision and noninvasive intervention upon the nervous system. Every few millimeters of the brain is functionally distinct, and different parts of the brain may have counteracting responses to therapy. To better match our therapies to neuroscience, we develop techniques that allow intervention upon only the right part of the nervous system at the right time, using technologies like focused ultrasound and nanotechnology. Impaired clearance of neurotoxic debris in the brain exacerbates neurologic disease and presents a promising therapeutic target. Pharmacologic therapies can enhance meningeal lymphatic clearance in preclinical models but may be limited by systemic toxicities or invasive administration. Here we report a low-intensity, focused ultrasound protocol that noninvasively clears pathogenic substances from the cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitium in mice. Using two models of hemorrhagic stroke, we demonstrate that this protocol clears the cerebrospinal fluid and interstitium of blood cells, which accumulate in the deep cervical lymph nodes via meningeal lymphatics. The protocol directly modulates molecular processes, including mechanosensitive channels, to shift microglial phenotypes and astrocytic aquaporin localization to reduce neuroinflammation and neurocytotoxicity. In the intracerebral hemorrhage model, it improves behavioral outcomes and increases survival with greater efficacy than a pharmacologic benchmark. The protocol satisfies Food and Drug Administration safety guidelines, supporting clinical translatability. If demonstrated effective clinically, it may provide therapeutic benefit not only in hemorrhagic stroke but also in other neurologic disorders that involve impaired debris clearance.

However, these systems often incorporate non-validated pharmaceutical excipients and other features that limit their clinical translation. Here we engineer the responsiveness of liposomes to a pulsed, low-intensity ultrasound activating stimulus by incorporating a generally regarded as safe excipient that alters the acoustic properties of the liposome core medium. We show that this approach permits loading and ultrasound-induced release of four drugs in vitro. We then leverage this performance to enable drug-mediated noninvasive neuromodulation of each of the central and the peripheral nervous system in vivo. These acoustically activatable liposomes formulated with common and validated pharmaceutical excipients and production processes provide a versatile system for stimulus-responsive site-targeted drug delivery and noninvasive neuromodulation, with high clinical translation potential.

The mid-20th century witnessed the rise of molecular mechanisms as pathophysiological and treatment models, with recent holistic proposals keeping this focus unaltered. In this perspective, we explore how psychiatry can utilize systems neuroscience to develop a vertically integrated understanding of brain function to inform treatment. Using schizophrenia as a case study, we discuss scale-related challenges faced by researchers studying molecules, circuits, networks, and cognition and clinicians operating within existing frameworks. We emphasize computation as a bridging language, with algorithmic models like hierarchical predictive processing offering explanatory potential for targeted interventions. Developing such models will not only facilitate new interventions but also optimize combining existing treatments by predicting their multi-level effects. We conclude with the prognosis that the future is bright, but that continued investment in research closely driven by clinical realities will be critical.

However, the mechanistic underpinnings of its therapeutic action remain unclear, and emerging clinical and preclinical evidence highlights a potential involvement of the opioid system. We used pharmacological functional ultrasound imaging data acquired during and after ketamine administration in male and female rats pretreated with naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, or vehicle. We found that ketamine-induced functional connectivity changes are modulated by opioid receptor blockade, and that these responses are dependent on biological sex. Specifically, naltrexone sex-dependently altered the connectivity patterns within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key node of the brain's default-mode network, and between the mPFC and other functional nodes. Furthermore, ketamine produced an opioid-dependent shift toward states of increased dysconnectivity and brain entropy in male rats only. Our findings warrant further investigation into the neurophysiological underpinnings of ketamine action and potential sex-specific interactions with opioid receptors.

We used focused ultrasound coupled with fiber photometry to identify optimal neuromodulation parameters for four different arousal centers of the brain in an effort to yield overt changes in behavior. Applying coordinate descent, we found that optimal parameters for excitation or inhibition are highly distinct, the effects of which are generally conserved across brain regions and cell types. Optimized stimulations induced clear, target-specific behavioral effects, whereas non-optimized protocols of equivalent energy resulted in substantially less or no change in behavior. These outcomes were independent of auditory confounds and, contrary to expectation, accompanied by a cyclooxygenase-dependent and prolonged reduction in local blood flow and temperature with brain-region-specific scaling. These findings demonstrate that carefully tuned and targeted ultrasound can exhibit powerful effects on complex behavior and physiology.

We have developed a noninvasive, low intensity transcranial focused ultrasound protocol that facilitates the removal of pathogenic substances from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain interstitium. This protocol clears neurofilament light chain (NfL) - an aging byproduct - in aged mice and clears red blood cells (RBCs) from the central nervous system in two mouse models of hemorrhagic brain injury. Cleared RBCs accumulate in the cervical lymph nodes from both the CSF and interstitial compartments, indicating clearance through meningeal lymphatics. Treating these hemorrhagic brain injury models with this ultrasound protocol reduced neuroinflammatory and neurocytotoxic profiles, improved behavioral outcomes, decreased morbidity and, importantly, increased survival. RBC clearance efficacy was blocked by mechanosensitive channel antagonism and was effective when applied in anesthetized subjects, indicating a mechanosensitive channel mediated mechanism that does not depend on sensory stimulation or a specific neural activity pattern. Notably, this protocol qualifies for an FDA non-significant risk designation given its low intensity, making it readily clinically translatable. Overall, our results demonstrate that this low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound protocol clears hemorrhage and other harmful substances from the brain via the meningeal lymphatic system, potentially offering a novel therapeutic tool for varied neurologic disorders.

While it is commonly classified as an N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, our picture of ketamine's mechanistic underpinnings is incomplete. Recent clinical evidence has indicated, controversially, that a component of the efficacy of subanesthetic ketamine may be opioid dependent. Using pharmacological functional ultrasound imaging in rats, we found that blocking opioid receptors suppressed neurophysiologic changes evoked by ketamine, but not by a more selective NMDAR antagonist, in limbic regions implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and in reward processing. Importantly, this opioid-dependent response was strongly sex-dependent, as it was not evident in female subjects and was fully reversed by surgical removal of the male gonads. We observed similar sex-dependent effects of opioid blockade affecting ketamine-evoked postsynaptic density and behavioral sensitization, as well as in opioid blockade-induced changes in opioid receptor density. Together, these results underscore the potential for ketamine to induce its affective responses via opioid signaling, and indicate that this opioid dependence may be strongly influenced by subject sex. These factors should be more directly assessed in future clinical trials.

However, the expansive parameter space and difficulties in controlling for peripheral auditory effects make it challenging to identify ultrasound sequences and brain targets that may provide therapeutic efficacy. Careful preclinical investigations in clinically relevant behavioral models are critically needed to identify suitable brain targets and acoustic parameters. However, there is a lack of ultrasound devices allowing for multi-target experimental investigations in awake and unrestrained rodents. We developed a miniaturized 64-element ultrasound array that enables neurointerventional investigations with within-trial active control targets in freely behaving rats. We first characterized the acoustic field with measurements in free water and with transcranial propagation. We then confirmed in vivo that the array can target multiple brain regions via electronic steering, and verified that wearing the device does not cause significant impairments to animal motility. Finally, we demonstrated the performance of our system in a high-throughput neuromodulation experiment, where we found that ultrasound stimulation of the rat central medial thalamus, but not an active control target, promotes arousal and increases locomotor activity.

However, most systems for ultrasonic drug uncaging utilize cavitation or heating as the drug release mechanism and often incorporate relatively exotic excipients into the formulation that together limit the drug-loading potential, stability, and clinical translatability and applicability of these systems. Here we describe an alternate strategy for the design of such systems in which the acoustic impedance and osmolarity of the internal liquid phase of a drug-loaded particle is tuned to maximize ultrasound-induced drug release. No gas phase, cavitation, or medium heating is necessary for the drug release mechanism. Instead, a non-cavitation-based mechanical response to ultrasound mediates the drug release. Importantly, this strategy can be implemented with relatively common pharmaceutical excipients, as we demonstrate here by implementing this mechanism with the inclusion of a few percent sucrose into the internal buffer of a liposome. Further, the ultrasound protocols sufficient for in vivo drug uncaging with this system are achievable with current clinical therapeutic ultrasound systems and with intensities that are within FDA and society guidelines for safe transcranial ultrasound application. Finally, this current implementation of this mechanism should be versatile and effective for the loading and uncaging of any therapeutic that may be loaded into a liposome, as we demonstrate for four different drugs in vitro, and two in vivo. These acoustomechanically activatable liposomes formulated with common pharmaceutical excipients promise a system with high clinical translational potential for ultrasonic drug uncaging of myriad drugs of clinical interest.

However, the utility of this route of administration is limited by poor brain and spinal cord parenchymal drug uptake from the cerebrospinal fluid. We demonstrate that a simple noninvasive transcranial ultrasound protocol can significantly increase influx of cerebrospinal fluid into the perivascular spaces of the brain, to enhance the uptake of intrathecally administered drugs. Specifically, we administered small (~1 kDa) and large (~155 kDa) molecule agents into the cisterna magna of rats and then applied low, diagnostic-intensity focused ultrasound in a scanning protocol throughout the brain. Using real-time magnetic resonance imaging and ex vivo histologic analyses, we observed significantly increased uptake of small molecule agents into the brain parenchyma, and of both small and large molecule agents into the perivascular space from the cerebrospinal fluid. Notably, there was no evidence of brain parenchymal damage following this intervention. The low intensity and noninvasive approach of transcranial ultrasound in this protocol underscores the ready path to clinical translation of this technique. In this manner, this protocol can be used to directly bypass the blood-brain barrier for whole-brain delivery of a variety of agents. Additionally, this technique can potentially be used as a means to probe the causal role of the glymphatic system in the variety of disease and physiologic processes to which it has been correlated.

So far, however, little is known about the impact of tcMRgFUS on structural connectivity. The objective of this study was to detect microstructural changes in tremor- and motor-related white matter tracts in essential tremor patients treated with tcMRgFUS thalamotomy. Methods Eleven patients diagnosed with essential tremor were enrolled in this tcMRgFUS thalamotomy study. For each patient, 3T MRI including structural and diffusion MRI were acquired and the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor was assessed prior to the procedure as well as one year after the treatment. Diffusion MRI tractography was performed to identify the cerebello-thalamo-cortical tract (CTCT), the medial lemniscus (ML) and the corticospinal tract (CST) in both hemispheres on pre-treatment data. Pre-treatment tractography results were co-registered to post-treatment diffusion data. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD), were averaged across the tracts in the pre- and post-treatment data. Results The mean value of tract-specific DTI metrics changed significantly within the thalamic lesion and in the CTCT on the treated side (p<0.05). Changes of DTI-derived indices within the CTCT correlated well with lesion overlap (FA: r=-0.54, p=0.04; MD: r=0.57, p=0.04); RD: r=0.67, p=0.036). Furthermore, a trend was seen for the correlation between changes of DTI-derived indices within the CTCT and clinical improvement (FA: r=0.58; p=0.062; MD: r=-0.52, p=0.64; RD: r=-0.61 p=0.090). Conclusions Microstructural changes were detected within the CTCT after tcMRgFUS and these changes correlated well with lesion-tract overlap. Our results show that diffusion MRI is able to detect the microstructural effects of tcMRgFUS, thereby further elucidating the treatment mechanism and ultimately to improve targeting prospectively.

To achieve sufficient blood flow sensitivity in the brain microvasculature, fUS relies on long ultrasound data acquisitions at high frame rates, posing high demands on the sampling and processing hardware. Here we develop an image reconstruction method based on deep learning that significantly reduces the amount of data necessary while retaining imaging performance. We trained convolutional neural networks to learn the power Doppler reconstruction function from sparse sequences of ultrasound data with compression factors of up to 95%. High-quality images from in vivo acquisitions in rats were used for training and performance evaluation. We demonstrate that time series of power Doppler images can be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy to detect the small changes in cerebral blood volume (~10%) characteristic of task-evoked cortical activation, even though the network was not formally trained to reconstruct such image series. The proposed platform may facilitate the development of this neuroimaging modality in any setting where dedicated hardware is not available or in clinical scanners.

However, relatively little is known regarding how varying treatment parameters affect the degree of neuroinflammation following BBB opening. The goal of this study was to evaluate the activation of an inflammatory response following BBB opening as a function of applied acoustic pressure using two different microbubble doses. Methods: Mice were treated with 650 kHz ultrasound using varying acoustic peak negative pressures (PNPs) using two different MB doses, and activation of an inflammatory response, in terms of microglial and astrocyte activation, was assessed one hour following BBB opening using immunohistochemical staining. Harmonic and subharmonic acoustic emissions (AEs) were monitored for all treatments with a passive cavitation detector, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) was performed following BBB opening to quantify the degree of opening. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were assessed for the presence of microhemorrhage and edema. Results: For each MB dose, BBB opening was achieved with minimal activation of microglia and astrocytes using a PNP of 0.15 MPa. Higher PNPs were associated with increased activation, with greater increases associated with the use of the higher MB dose. Additionally, glial activation was still observed in the absence of histopathological findings. We found that CE-MRI was most strongly correlated with the degree of activation. While acoustic emissions were not predictive of microglial or astrocyte activation, subharmonic AEs were strongly associated with marked and severe histopathological findings. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that there were mild histologic changes and activation of the acute inflammatory response using PNPs ranging from 0.15 MPa to 0.20 MPa, independent of MB dose. However, when higher PNPs of 0.25 MPa or above were applied, the same applied PNP resulted in more severe and widespread histological findings and activation of the acute inflammatory response when using the higher MB dose. The potential activation of the inflammatory response following ultrasound-mediated BBB opening should be considered when treating patients to maximize therapeutic benefit.

Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging technology that can noninvasively deliver energy up the order of 1 kW/cm2 with millimeter and millisecond resolution to any point in the human brain with Food and Drug Administration-approved hardware. Although FUS is clinically utilized primarily for focal ablation in conditions such as essential tremor, recent breakthroughs have enabled the use of FUS for drug delivery at lower intensities (i.e., tens of watts per square centimeter) without ablation of the tissue. In this review, we present strategies for image-guided FUS-mediated pharmacologic neurointerventions. First, we discuss blood-brain barrier opening to deliver therapeutic agents of a variety of sizes to the central nervous system. We then describe the use of ultrasound-sensitive nanoparticles to noninvasively deliver small molecules to millimeter-sized structures including superficial cortical regions and deep gray matter regions within the brain without the need for blood-brain barrier opening. We also consider the safety and potential complications of these techniques, with attention to temporal acuity. Finally, we close with a discussion of different methods for mapping the ultrasound field within the brain and describe future avenues of research in ultrasound-targeted drug therapies.

Mice bearing subcutaneous CT26 colon tumors were injected i.v. with 1 g/kg (535 mg iodine/kg) IX-lipo, and in vivo CT and CEST MR images were acquired on day 3. CT and CEST MR images were also acquired for tumor-bearing mice co-injected with IX-lipo and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1).In addition to CT contrast, IX-lipo exhibited a strong CEST contrast similar to its non-liposomal form, with a detectability of ~2 nM per liposome. Both CT imaging and CEST MRI showed that i.v. injection of IX-lipo resulted in a rim enhancement of CT26 tumors with a heterogeneous central distribution. In contrast, co-injection of TNF-\u03b1 caused a significantly augmented CT/MRI contrast in the tumor center. The intratumoral biodistribution of IX-lipo correlated well to the rhodamine patterns observed with fluorescence microscopy.We have developed a CT/MRI bimodal imaging approach for monitoring the delivery and biodistribution of liposomes by loading them with the clinically approved X-ray/CT contrast agent iodixanol. Our approach may be easily adapted for other-FDA approved iodinated agents and thus has great translational potential.

However, these procedures are limited by their invasiveness and relatively broad drug spatial distribution. The ideal technique for local pharmacotherapy would be noninvasive and would flexibly deliver a given drug to any region of the body with high spatial and temporal precision. Combining polymeric perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions with existent clinical focused ultrasound systems could in principle meet these needs, but it has not been clear whether these nanoparticles could provide the necessary drug loading, stability, and generalizability across a range of drugs, beyond a few niche applications. Here, we develop polymeric perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions into a generalized platform for ultrasound-targeted delivery of hydrophobic drugs with high potential for clinical translation. We demonstrate that a wide variety of drugs may be effectively uncaged with ultrasound using these nanoparticles, with drug loading increasing with hydrophobicity. We also set the stage for clinical translation by delineating production protocols that are scalable and yield sterile, stable, and optimized ultrasound-activated drug-loaded nanoemulsions. Finally, we exhibit a new potential application of these nanoemulsions for local control of vascular tone. This work establishes the power of polymeric perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions as a clinically-translatable platform for efficacious, noninvasive, and localized ultrasonic drug uncaging for myriad targets in the brain and body.

To enable robust perturbation of brain activity while leveraging the ability of focused ultrasound to deliver energy to any point of the brain noninvasively, we have developed biocompatible and clinically translatable nanoparticles that allow ultrasound-induced uncaging of neuromodulatory drugs. Utilizing the anesthetic propofol, together with electrophysiological and imaging assays, we show that the neuromodulatory effect of ultrasonic drug uncaging is limited spatially and temporally by the size of the ultrasound focus, the sonication timing, and the pharmacokinetics of the uncaged drug. Moreover, we see secondary effects in brain regions anatomically distinct from and functionally connected to the sonicated region, indicating that ultrasonic drug uncaging could noninvasively map the changes in functional network connectivity associated with pharmacologic action at a particular brain target.

Diffusion and structural MRI data and clinical evaluations were acquired pre-treatment and post-treatment. To identify the optimal target location, tractography was performed on pre-treatment diffusion MRI data between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus. The tractography-identified locations were compared to the lesion location delineated on 1 year post-treatment T2-weighted MR image. Their overlap was correlated with the clinical outcomes measured by the percentage change of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor scores acquired pre-treatment, as well as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment.Results: The probabilistic tractography was consistent from subject-to-subject and followed the expected anatomy of the thalamocortical radiation and the dentatothalamic tract. Higher overlap between the tractography-identified location and the tcMRgFUS treatment-induced lesion highly correlated with better treatment outcome (r = -0.929, -0.75, -0.643, p = 0.00675, 0.0663, 0.139 for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus, respectively, at 1 year post-treatment). The correlation for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex is the highest for all time points (r = -0.719, -0.976, -0.707, -0.929, p = 0.0519, 0.000397, 0.0595, 0.00675 at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment, respectively).Conclusion: Our data support the use of diffusion tractography as a complementary approach to current targeting methods for tcMRgFUS thalamotomy.

Toward this goal, we have developed nanoparticles that allow noninvasive uncaging of a neuromodulatory drug, in this case the small molecule anesthetic propofol, upon the application of focused ultrasound. These nanoparticles are composed of biodegradable and biocompatible constituents and are activated using sonication parameters that are readily achievable by current clinical transcranial focused ultrasound systems. These particles are potent enough that their activation can silence seizures in an acute rat seizure model. Notably, there is no evidence of brain parenchymal damage or blood-brain barrier opening with their use.

In particular, unless a particular transporter exists that may transport the agent across the BBB, most agents that are larger than 500 Da or that are hydrophilic will be excluded by the BBB. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), also known as the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in the periphery, has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric conditions. As all agents that target GCPII are hydrophilic and thereby excluded from the CNS, we used GCPII as a platform for demonstrating our MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) technique for delivery of GCPII/PSMA-specific imaging agents to the brain.Female rats underwent MRgFUS-mediated opening of the BBB. After opening of the BBB, either a radio- or fluorescently labeled ureido-based ligand for GCPII/PSMA was administered intravenously. Brain uptake was assessed for 2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-[(18)F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid ([(18)F]DCFPyL) and YC-27, two compounds known to bind GCPII/PSMA with high affinity, using positron emission tomography (PET) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, respectively. Specificity of ligand binding to GCPII/PSMA in the brain was determined with co-administration of a molar excess of ZJ-43, a compound of the same chemical class but different structure from either [(18)F]DCFPyL or YC-27, which competes for GCPII/PSMA binding.Dynamic PET imaging using [(18)F]DCFPyL demonstrated that target uptake reached a plateau by \u223c1 h after radiotracer administration, with target/background ratios continuing to increase throughout the course of imaging, from a ratio of \u223c4:1 at 45 min to \u223c7:1 by 80 min. NIRF imaging likewise demonstrated delivery of YC-27 to the brain, with clear visualization of tracer in the brain at 24 h. Tissue uptake of both ligands was greatly diminished by ZJ-43 co-administration, establishing specificity of binding of each to GCPII/PSMA. On gross and histological examination, animals showed no evidence for hemorrhage or other deleterious consequences of MRgFUS.MRgFUS provided safe opening of the BBB to enable specific delivery of two hydrophilic agents to target tissues within the brain. This platform might facilitate imaging and therapy using a variety of agents that have heretofore been excluded from the CNS.

For optimal individual subject characterization, specific acquisition and analysis features need to be identified that maximize interindividual variability while concomitantly minimizing intra-subject variability. We delineate the effect of various acquisition parameters (length of acquisition, sampling frequency) and analysis methods (time course extraction, region of interest parcellation, and thresholding of connectivity-derived network graphs) on characterizing individual subject differentiation. We utilize a non-parametric statistical metric that quantifies the degree to which a parameter set allows this individual subject differentiation by both maximizing interindividual variance and minimizing intra-individual variance. We apply this metric to analysis of four publicly available test-retest resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data sets. We find that for the question of maximizing individual differentiation, (i) for increasing sampling, there is a relative tradeoff between increased sampling frequency and increased acquisition time; (ii) for the sizes of the interrogated data sets, only 3-4 min of acquisition time was sufficient to maximally differentiate each subject with an algorithm that utilized no a priori information regarding subject identification; and (iii) brain regions that most contribute to this individual subject characterization lie in the default mode, attention, and executive control networks. These findings may guide optimal rs-fMRI experiment design and may elucidate the neural bases for subject-to-subject differences.

Rs-vs-task-fMRI concordance was measured using Dice coefficients across varying fMRI thresholds before and after noise removal. Multi-thresholded Dice coefficient volume under the surface (DiceVUS) and maximum Dice coefficient (MaxDice) were calculated. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine significance of DiceVUS and MaxDice between the four ICA order groups. Age, Sex, Handedness, Tumor Side, Tumor Size, WHO Grade, number of scrubbed volumes, image intensity root mean square (iRMS), and mean framewise displacement (FD) were used as predictors for VUS in a linear regression.Artificial elevation of rs-fMRI vs task-fMRI concordance is seen at low thresholds due to noise. Noise-removed group-mean DiceVUS and MaxDice improved as ICA order increased, however ANOVA demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the four groups. Linear regression demonstrated an association between iRMS and DiceVUS for ICA30-50, and iRMS and MaxDice for ICA50.Overall there is moderate group level rs-vs-task fMRI language network concordance, however substantial subject-level variability exists; iRMS may be used to determine reliability of rs-fMRI derived language networks.

For each of the seven patients who demonstrated evidence of NVU on task-based motor fMRI, we performed both an independent component analysis (ICA) and an atlas-based parcellation-based seed correlation analysis (SCA) of the resting state fMRI data. For each patient, ipsilesional (IL) and contralesional (CL) regions of interest (ROIs) comprising primary motor and somatosensory cortices were used to evaluate BOLD signal changes on Z score maps derived from both ICA and SCA analysis for evidence of NVU. A subsequent two-tailed t-test was performed to determine whether statistically significant differences between the two sides were present that were consistent with NVU.In seven patients, overall decreased BOLD signal (based on suprathreshold voxels in ICA and SCA-derived Z-score maps) was noted in IL compared with CL ROIs (P < 0.01), consistent with NVU.We have demonstrated that NVU can result in false negative BOLD signal changes on rsfMRI comparable to previously published findings on standard motor task-based fMRI.

In this manuscript, the problem of quantifying the reproducibility of graphical measurements is considered. The image intra-class correlation coefficient (I2C2) is generalized and the graphical intra-class correlation coefficient (GICC) is proposed for such purpose. The concept for GICC is based on multivariate probit-linear mixed effect models. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo EM (mcm-cEM) algorithm is used for estimating the GICC. Simulation results with varied settings are demonstrated and our method is applied to the KIRBY21 test-retest dataset.

Underglycosylated mucin-1 (uMUC1) is overexpressed in most malignant adenocarcinomas of epithelial origin (for example, colon, breast and ovarian cancer). Its counterpart MUC1 is a large polymer rich in glycans containing multiple exchangeable OH protons, which is readily detectable by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. We show here that deglycosylation of MUC1 results in >75% reduction in CEST signal. Three uMUC1(+) human malignant cancer cell lines overexpressing uMUC1 (BT20, HT29 and LS174T) show a significantly lower CEST signal compared with the benign human epithelial cell line MCF10A and the uMUC1(-) tumour cell line U87. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in vivo CEST MRI is able to make a distinction between LS174T and U87 tumour cells implanted in the mouse brain. These results suggest that the mucCEST MRI signal can be used as a label-free surrogate marker to non-invasively assess mucin glycosylation and tumour malignancy.

Autopsy studies of brains from a limited number of former athletes have described characteristic, pathologic changes of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) leading to questions about the relationship between these pathologic and the neuropsychiatric disturbances seen in former athletes. Research in this area will depend on in vivo methods that characterize molecular changes in the brain, linking CTE and other sports-related pathologies with delayed emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. In this pilot project we studied former National Football League (NFL) players using new neuroimaging techniques and clinical measures of cognitive functioning. We hypothesized that former NFL players would show molecular and structural changes in medial temporal and parietal lobe structures as well as specific cognitive deficits, namely those of verbal learning and memory. We observed a significant increase in binding of [(11)C]DPA-713 to the translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of brain injury and repair, in several brain regions, such as the supramarginal gyrus and right amygdala, in 9 former NFL players compared to 9 age-matched, healthy controls. We also observed significant atrophy of the right hippocampus. Finally, we report that these same former players had varied performance on a test of verbal learning and memory, suggesting that these molecular and pathologic changes may play a role in cognitive decline. These results suggest that localized brain injury and repair, indicated by increased [(11)C]DPA-713 binding to TSPO, may be linked to history of NFL play. [(11)C]DPA-713 PET is a promising new tool that can be used in future study design to examine further the relationship between TSPO expression in brain injury and repair, selective regional brain atrophy, and the potential link to deficits in verbal learning and memory after NFL play.

Multiple neuron types and brain regions are involved in reward processing, posing fascinating scientific questions, and major experimental challenges. Using diverse approaches including genetics, electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral analysis, a large body of research has focused on both normal functioning of the reward circuitry and on its potential significance in neuropsychiatric diseases. In this introduction, we illustrate a real-world application of optogenetics to mammalian behavior and physiology, delineating procedures and technologies for optogenetic control of individual components of the reward circuitry. We describe the experimental setup and protocol for integrating optogenetic modulation of dopamine neurons with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, conditioned place preference, and operant conditioning to assess the causal role of well-defined electrical and biochemical signals in reward-related behavior.

Pharmacological studies have implicated certain neurotransmitter systems in social behavior, but circuit-level understanding of endogenous neural activity during social interaction is lacking. We therefore developed and applied a new methodology, termed fiber photometry, to optically record natural neural activity in genetically and connectivity-defined projections to elucidate the real-time role of specified pathways in mammalian behavior. Fiber photometry revealed that activity dynamics of a ventral tegmental area (VTA)-to-nucleus accumbens (NAc) projection could encode and predict key features of social, but not novel object, interaction. Consistent with this observation, optogenetic control of cells specifically contributing to this projection was sufficient to modulate social behavior, which was mediated by type 1 dopamine receptor signaling downstream in the NAc. Direct observation of deep projection-specific activity in this way captures a fundamental and previously inaccessible dimension of mammalian circuit dynamics.

The new atlas combines a \"deep gray matter parcellation map\" (DGMPM) derived from a single-subject quantitative susceptibility map with the previously established \"white matter parcellation map\" (WMPM) from the same subject's T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging data into an MNI coordinate map named the \"Everything Parcellation Map in Eve Space,\" also known as the \"EvePM.\" It allows automated segmentation of gray matter and white matter structures. Quantitative susceptibility maps from five healthy male volunteers (30 to 33 years of age) were coregistered to the Eve Atlas with AIR and Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM), and the transformation matrices were applied to the EvePM to produce automated parcellation in subject space. Parcellation accuracy was measured with a kappa analysis for the left and right structures of six deep gray matter regions. For multi-orientation QSM images, the Kappa statistic was 0.85 between automated and manual segmentation, with the inter-rater reproducibility Kappa being 0.89 for the human raters, suggesting \"almost perfect\" agreement between all segmentation methods. Segmentation seemed slightly more difficult for human raters on single-orientation QSM images, with the Kappa statistic being 0.88 between automated and manual segmentation, and 0.85 and 0.86 between human raters. Overall, this atlas provides a time-efficient tool for automated coregistration and segmentation of quantitative susceptibility data to analyze many regions of interest. These data were used to establish a baseline for normal magnetic susceptibility measurements for over 60 brain structures of 30- to 33-year-old males. Correlating the average susceptibility with age-based iron concentrations in gray matter structures measured by Hallgren and Sourander (1958) allowed interpolation of the average iron concentration of several deep gray matter regions delineated in the EvePM.

In this respect, MRI was a perfect fit, because of the versatile possibility to alter the different contrast mechanisms. Genetic manipulations are now being translated to MRI through the development of reporters and sensors, as well as the imaging of transgenic and knockout mice. In the past few years, a new molecular biology toolset, namely optogenetics, has emerged, which allows for the manipulation of cellular behavior using light. This technology provides a few particularly attractive features for combination with newly developed MRI techniques for the probing of in vivo cellular and, in particular, neural processes, specifically the ability to control focal, genetically defined cellular populations with high temporal resolution using equipment that is magnetically inert and does not interact with radiofrequency pulses. Recent studies have demonstrated that the combination of optogenetics and functional MRI (fMRI) can provide an appropriate platform to investigate in vivo, at the cellular and molecular levels, the neuronal basis of fMRI signals. In addition, this novel combination of optogenetics with fMRI has the potential to resolve pre-synaptic versus post-synaptic changes in neuronal activity and changes in the activity of large neuronal networks in the context of plasticity associated with development, learning and pathophysiology.

The ability to monitor kinase activity in vivo and in real-time with high spatial resolution in genetically specified cellular populations is a yet unmet need, crucial for understanding complex biological systems as well as for preclinical development and screening of novel therapeutics.Using the hypothesis that the natural recognition sequences of protein kinases may be detected using chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging, we designed a genetically encoded biosensor composed of eight tandem repeats of the peptide LRRASLG, a natural target of PKA.This sensor displays a measurable change in chemical exchange saturation transfer signal following phosphorylation by PKA. The natural PKA substrate LRRASLG exhibits a chemical exchange saturation transfer-magnetic resonance imaging contrast at +1.8 and +3.6 ppm, with a >50% change after phosphorylation with minutes-scale temporal resolution. Expression of a synthetic gene encoding eight monomers of LRRASLG yielded two peaks at these chemical exchange saturation transfer frequencies.Taken together, these results suggest that this gene may be used to assay PKA levels in a biologically relevant system. Importantly, the design strategy used for this specific sensor may be adapted for a host of clinically interesting protein kinases.

Here we collect in detail our strategies for delivering microbial opsin genes to deep mammalian brain structures in vivo, along with protocols for integrating the resulting optical control with compatible readouts (electrophysiological, optical and behavioral). The procedures described here, from initial virus preparation to systems-level functional readout, can be completed within 4-5 weeks.

Here we report the development of a versatile family of genetically encoded optical tools ('optoXRs') that leverage common structure-function relationships among G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to recruit and control, with high spatiotemporal precision, receptor-initiated biochemical signalling pathways. In particular, we have developed and characterized two optoXRs that selectively recruit distinct, targeted signalling pathways in response to light. The two optoXRs exerted opposing effects on spike firing in nucleus accumbens in vivo, and precisely timed optoXR photostimulation in nucleus accumbens by itself sufficed to drive conditioned place preference in freely moving mice. The optoXR approach allows testing of hypotheses regarding the causal impact of biochemical signalling in behaving mammals, in a targetable and temporally precise manner.

Second, both fast circuit control and imaging should be adaptable to intact-circuit preparations from normal and diseased subjects. Here we illustrate integration of fast optical circuit control and fast circuit imaging, review recent work demonstrating utility of applying fast imaging to quantifying activity flow in disease models, and discuss integration of diverse optogenetic and chemical genetic tools that have been developed to precisely control the activity of genetically specified neural populations.
